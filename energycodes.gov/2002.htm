<P><B>Current Status Commercial:</B><BR>
<p>ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for only state-owned or -funded buildings.</p>  

<p>With the exception of state-owned or -funded buildings, Alabama has not adopted a commercial energy code, nor does it have preemptive authority over units of local government for the establishment of a state energy code.   State-owned or -funded buildings are covered by the Alabama Building Energy Conservation Code (ABECC), which has prescriptive and performance based criteria that generally conform to ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<BR>


<P><B>Can use COMcheck to show compliance:</B><BR>

	Not Available<BR>


<P><B>Commercial Energy Code is mandatory statewide:</B><BR>

	Not Available<BR>


<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The state has made available a draft of the RECA 2000.  This voluntary code is based on the 1995 MEC.  Residential designers will be able to comly with RECA by following the prescriptive standards, by complying with the "Systems Analysis" approach specified in the 1995 MEC or by complying with the "Component Performance" approach specified in the 1995 Edition of the MEC.  The use of alternative analysis procedures, which meet the requirements of the 1995 MEC, may be accepted in lieu of the code.  The new code still needs to be okayed by the RECA Board, which is awaiting new appointments by the Governor.  (BCAP May/June 2000)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

For other than state-owned or -funded buildings, local governement must adopt the code to be implemented.  The code is usually adopted through a vote of the city council or county commission.  Depending on the form of government, the mayor may be required to sign the law.  For state-funded buildings, the Alabama Building Commission must adopt revisions to the code.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

For state-owned or-funded buildings, the Alabama Building Commission reviews plans and specifications to ensure compliance.  For other buildings in localities that have adopted an energy code, compliance is addressed through the normal permit process.  Typically plans are submitted and reviewed and buildings are inspected during construction.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

For state-owned or -funded buildings, the design professional works with the Alabama Building Commission to establish compliance.  For other buildings, units of local government enforce compliance. If a local government adopts the 1995 MEC, the code requirements are enforced through the permit/inspection process for new construction and additions.  Depending on the size of the local government unit, the same office may perform plan reviews and inspections.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Prior to July 31, 1995, cities and counties in Alabama were free to adopt energy codes as they deemed appropriate.  Most cities and counties that adopted an energy code adopted Appendix E of the 1994 Standard Building Code (SBC), or a prior edition of the SBC.  Chapter 13 of the 1994 SBC references Appendix E of the 1994 SBC, which in turn references the 1993  MEC.  Appendix E allows alternatives to complying with the 1995 MEC, which are ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for commercial buildings and ANSI/ASHRAE/IES 90A-1980 and ASHRAE/IES 90B-1975 for residential buildings.

<p>On July 31, 1995, the Governor of Alabama signed House Bill (HB) 616.  HB 616 requires cities and counties that choose to adopt a residential building energy code to adopt the 1993 CABO MEC or its successors.  HB 616 defines the MEC as follows:  "The 1993 Edition of the Model Energy Code as prepared and maintained by the Council of American Building Officials, or any subsequent editions, changes, or recompilations thereof, or any other energy code, which the board has officially adopted."</p>

<p>HB 616 created the Alabama Residential Energy Code Board to promote the use and implementation of the MEC in Alabama.  The Board advises the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) on implementation activities and provides for the mandatory implementation of and adherence to the MEC if a unit of local government so chooses to adopt it in whole or in part.</p>

<p>ADECA reported passage of the bill to the U.S. Department of Energy as part of their residential energy code certification under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 in a second certification letter dated August 8, 1995.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>BEES provides minimum energy efficiency requirements for the building envelope, air leakage, moisture control, heating system efficiency, and duct/piping insulation.  BEES also includes requirements for supplying a minimum amount of outside air.  Alaska is divided into five climate zones with different envelope insulation requirements for each zone based on climate and fuel cost.  Compliance with the current standards for residential buildings may be shown using one of four envelope compliance methods:  1) prescriptive, 2) performance, 3) building budget, or 4) state-approved home energy rating methods.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Proposed changes to the standards for residential buildings can be submitted to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, which reviews and acts on the proposals.  Public hearings are required before changes are adopted.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance with BEES is covered by local building officials, banks, or the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.  A standardized compliance form is required to be furnished with mortgage packages for mortgage-financed residences.  Certification may also be made by the architect, engineer, an International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) certified building inspector, or a local building code official.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Builders must certify compliance with the BEES requirements by completing a standardized compliance form that must be furnished with the mortgage package.  The builder may choose one of the following methods to show compliance:  1) inspection and certification by a registered architect or engineer or by an ICBO certified building inspector, 2) state-approved home energy rating methods, 3) certification by the local building code official when the local energy code is at least as stringent as the BEES requirements, or 4 ) certification by a builder who has taken the appropriate Building Science Training.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first energy standard for the state of Alaska was introduced in 1985.  When the state was about to implement this standard, the home builders in Alaska filed an injunction to stop implementation, claiming they did not have adequate opportunity to testify.  The courts halted the implementation date pending a review.  As part of that review, the state and home builders agreed to include the Home Energy Rating Method as a way to show compliance with the standard.  BEES became effective on January 1, 1992.   Residential buildings are now required to comply with BEES, which equates to a 4 plus star energy rating.  Local jurisdictions are permitted to adopt other standards that meet or exceed the BEES requirements.<BR>

<p>The local Department of Public Works is in the process of having the ICBO 1994 Uniform Building Code approved by the local legislature.  The American Samoa Energy Office (i.e., ASPA Energy Center), in joint cooperation with the Guam Energy Office, has obtained a federal grant under EPAct for technical assistance to develop a tropical island-specific model energy code.</p>

<p>This code will be designed to be easily applied and modified to meet not only Guam and American Samoa requirements, but also the requirements of other tropical island territories and nations.  The island-specific code would adopt cost-effective building energy technologies that meet or exceed the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC) and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<p>American Samoa completed development of a Commercial Building Energy Code in 1997.  From 1998-2000, the code process was tested by taking a government office building through the code process from plan review to occupancy.  American Samoa will not pursue adoption of the building energy code but will pursue development and adoption of an appropriate appliance standard for the entire territory.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Some local jurisdictions, including Pima County and the City of Tucson, have adopted the 1995  Model Energy Code (MEC.)  A house bill was introduced in February 1999 to establish an energy code commission to look into a voluntary energy code for the state.  The bill would direct the commission to adopt by rule a voluntary energy code based on the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), which in turn could be adopted by local municipalities.  The state is participating in a U.S. Department of Energy funded project with Utah and Nevada on energy code adoption and implementation as well as promoting energy efficiency standards above the 1995 MEC.</p>

<p>Legislation has been signed into law that establishes voluntary adoption of the 2000 IECC and ASHRAE 90.1-1999 statewide.  The legislation, House Bill 2541, also calls for the establishment of a State Energy Advisory Commission to review and make recommendations regarding the state energy code and to provide training and implementation strategies.  Tuscons/Pima county has adopted the 98 IECC, and Scottsdale is actively pursuing adoption of the 2000 IECC.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

No procedure exists for modifying the energy guidelines at the state level.  It is unlikely that a statewide code will be passed due to the independence of the local governments.  However, changes to the Arizona Fire Code (the only statewide mandatory code) are on a three-year code cycle corresponding with the publication of the International Conference of Building Officials Uniform Codes.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Commercial:  For state-owned buildings, plans may be submitted to the Arizona Energy Office for review and comment.  However, submitting plans is not a mandatory requirement. No requirements exist for plan review or required inspections.

<p>Residential:  A home energy rating system is used for residential buildings.  This system is market-driven and is completely voluntary.  The local utility provides the compliance review and rating based on a points system.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

No mandatory energy inspection procedures exist at the state level for any building construction.  The Arizona Energy Office may review energy code requirements for state-owned commercial buildings if requested to do so by the responsible governmental agency.  No mandatory field inspections exist for state-owned commercial buildings.  Local enforcement agencies are responsible for enforcing local energy codes.  Note that some jurisdictions may adopt the International Conference of Building Officials Uniform Building Code and enforce energy requirements for non state-owned buildings.  For one- and two-family dwellings, the local utility provides the inspections required to ensure compliance with the Home Energy Rating<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

No mandatory statewide energy efficiency requirements for either residential or commercial buildings have existed except for state-owned commercial buildings.  All energy codes that do exist are adopted and enforced at the local level.

<p>The Arizona Guidelines for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction contained the mandatory minimum energy efficiency requirements for all state-owned commercial buildings that were heated and/or cooled.  However, plan reviews and inspections were not required at the state level.  Pima County, which encompasses the Tucson Metropolitan area, and the city of Tucson have adopted the 1995 MEC.</p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

State Level:  A rule-making process is used to adopt new codes and change existing codes.  When a proposed code change is initiated by the Arkansas Energy Office (AEO), it is first reviewed by the affected parties.  They evaluate the proposed changes and work with the AEO to refine them to satisfy all parties, if possible.   All changes are then submitted for public hearing.  After approval at the public hearing, the proposed change is acted upon by the AEO and by two legislative committees before it is included in the next edition of the code.

<p>Local Level:  The local government may adopt and implement the code, which is usually achieved through a vote of the city council or county commission.  Depending on the form of government, the mayor may be required to sign the law.</p>

<p>Because compliance is based on self-certification by the builder, the builder must address compliance upon request when the local government has not adopted the code.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Proof and verification of compliance is required statewide for all buildings by the responsible party (e.g., builder) signing a self-certification seal.  In jurisdictions that have adopted the energy code, a local inspection is required to verify compliance and the builder must sign the self-certification seal.  The certification seal must be placed in the building for visible inspection.   A state Board of Appeals (BOA) has been established in the regulations to resolve different interpretations of the standards.  The code requires local jurisdictions that adopt the code to also establish a BOA.

<p>Builders of residential buildings currently self-certify that they have complied with the 1994 Arkansas Energy Code by completing and signing an adhesive certification seal that is placed either on the circuit panel or the heating/cooling cabinet.  The certification seal only documents the building's envelope R- and U-values.  Compliance with the Arkansas Energy Code is determined by selecting from a set of simplified options or by using ARKcheck, a state specific software version of MECcheck.  These tools are used to determine minimal thermal shell requirements for residential buildings based on the 1992 MEC.  Builders of commercial buildings are expected to comply with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

In jurisdictions that have adopted codes, units of local government enforce the codes through the established inspection process.  Depending on the size of the local government, the same individual may be responsible for performing plan reviews and inspections.  In jurisdictions that have not adopted codes, state enforcement staff or their agents use spot inspections and consumer notifications.

<p>Because the compliance system is based on self-certification by the builder and because enforcement can depend homeowner involvement, the AEO has spent considerable effort on education and communication.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first Arkansas Energy Code was enacted in 1979 and was based on the 1977 Model Code for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction (MCEC), which references ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  Legislation was approved in January 1993 giving the AEO the authority to adopt new standards through a rule-making process. The AEO adopted a new code in October 1994 that became effective June 1, 1995.  This code references ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for commercial buildings and is based on the 1992 MEC for residential buildings.  The code was again editorially revised on May 3, 1995.  This revision made no substantive changes to the energy code.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The code applies to all buildings that are heated and/or mechanically cooled and are defined under the Uniform Building Code as A, B, E, H, N, R, or S occupancies, except registered historical buildings.  Additions and renovations are also covered by the code.  Institutional building's which include hospitals and prisons are not covered.</p>

<p>For residential low-rise buildings the current code provision include compliance credits for high performance ducts and building envelope features.  The size of credit depends on the action taken.  For example simply designing ducts to Air Conditioner Contractor's Association guidelines or properly sealing duct joints provided lower levels of credit than having the HVAC system tested for duct leaks.  To take credit for these mesure the installer and inspector must be trained and certified.</p>

<p>Local governmental agencies can modify the state energy code to be more stringent when documentation is provided to the California Energy Commission.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The Commission adopts updates to the energy efficiency standards for both residential and nonresidential buildings on a periodic basis, designed to coincide with the triennial publication of the state and model building codes.  Updates account for technology improvements, market penetration and improved processes.  Proposed changes are reviewed for a technical merit, cost effectiveness and environmental impacts.  The full Commission adopts appropriate changes after a formal rule making proceeding.  Public and stakeholder input are sought throughout the staff analysis stage and the formal rule making proceeding.  Adopted standards are submitted to the Buildings Standards Commission for approval (checked for conflicts with other codes) and published as Part 6 of Title 24<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Currently both a prescriptive package and computer compliance approach are available to determine compliance for both the nonresidential and residential energy standards.  Manuals for both residential and nonresidential construction are available.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Plans and specifications are submitted to and reviewed by the local city or county, building departments responsible for issuing the building permit.  The department of General Services is the enforcement agency of public schools and state-owned buildings.

<p>The enforcement agency cannot issue a building permit until it has been determined that the building design complies with all energy code requirements.</p>

<p>Field inspections are required by the enforcement agency prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy or final approval.  Installation certificates for all equipment and manufacture devices required to comply with the efficiency requirements must be posted on-site or made available to the inspector and provide to the first building owner at the time of occupancy.  An insulation certificate must be posted indicating that installed R-values are consistent with the plans, specifications, and manufacturer's recommendations.  Operation and maintenance information for the mechanical equipment and devices must be provided to the person responsible for operating and maintaining the building.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first statewide energy requirements were established in 1975 by the Department of Housing and Community Development for all low-rise residential buildings.  In 1974 the California legislature passed the Warren-Alquist Act establishing the California Energy Commission and authorizing the Commission to establish energy requirements for both residential and commercial buildings.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Ft. Collins and other local jurisdictions have adopted a modified 1995 MEC and ASHRAE 90.1-1989.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Colorado is a home rule state so no statewide energy code exists.  Voluntary adoption of energy codes is encouraged and efforts through OEMC and DOE grants  are directed toward informing local jurisdictions of the benefits of energy efficiency standards and providing materials and training to support code implementation.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is based on the requirements of the local jurisdictions.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Energy codes are not enforced at the state level.  Local enforcement agencies in jurisdictions that have adopted building codes are required to enforce the provisions of the residential energy code at the local level, but may adopt their own requirements without state approval.  Inspections are required as a part of the established building inspection process.

<p>No special inspection requirements exist for state-owned and -funded buildings.  These inspections are handled by the local enforcement agencies.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The Colorado legislature passed a law in 1978 requiring all jurisdictions that have adopted building codes to include energy efficiency requirements for both residential and commercial buildings.  The energy requirement at that time was based on Chapter 53 of the 1979 Uniform Building Code (UBC) -- a codified version of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  A sunset provision was included for commercial buildings requiring the legislature to specifically extend the provisions for those buildings.  The legislature failed to act and the commercial requirements were terminated in 1980, except for jurisdicitions that had adopted this code prior to the termination.  Since that time, no state-adopted energy code has existed for buildings other than one- and two-family dwellings and multi-family residential buildings three stories or less in height, although local jurisdictions can and do adopt their own energy requirements.  For example, the city of Ft. Collins adopted a modified version of the 1995 MEC and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 effective July 1, 1996<BR>

<p>Water Conservation System:  The Building Safety Official requires the construction of water catchment facilities in all buildings that must comply with the code.  To the greatest extent feasible, such catchments must be sized to provide adequate water to flush all toilets in the building.  The Building Safety Official is encouraged to approve alternative systems of sewage disposal that conserve potable water and meet all applicable public health standards.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The Building Safety Code was developed through legislative action.  The rules and regulations governing the administrative procedures of the Building Safety Code were formulated by the Department of Public Works and were put up for Public Notice.  Changes in the code can only be made through legislative action.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The Building Safety Code Division requires the submission of plans duly signed/stamped by an architect/engineer registered in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, together with the application for a building permit.  These plans are reviewed by the Plans Examiner for code compliance.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Building Safety Code Division in the Department of Public Works is the enforcing agency.  Field inspections are regularly conducted by certified building inspectors from the Building Safety Code Division to ensure compliance.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first Building Safety Code of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was enacted by the 6th Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature and was signed into Public Law on February 2, 1990.  The code adopts the 1991 Uniform Building Code, including Chapter 53 (for commercial and all multi-family buildings), and the 1989 Council of American Building Officials (CABO) One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code.  On January 2, 1992, the Building Safety Code was first enforced with the establishment of the Building Safety Code Division in the Department of Public Works.  The Building Safety Code Division processes an average of 250 building permit applications for multi-family residential and commercial buildings per year, and an average of 150 building permit applications for single-family dwellings per year.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Connecticut Energy Code (CEC) applies to all buildings and additions to existing buildings.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Connecticut General Statute #29-265(b), all residential building energy provisions listed in the state building code are based on the 1996 Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International and the 1995 MEC.</p>

<p>All commercial buildings except buildings less than 5,000 sq. ft. (having separate alternative requirements) must comply with the ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 requirment pursuant to Public Act 90-219, Section 3.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The state building code, including any amendments to the code adopted by the state building inspector and codes and standards committee, is the building code for all towns, cities, and boroughs in the state.  Any town, city, borough, or interested person may propose amendments to the state building code.  Once approved, the amendments become part of the state building code and are applied statewide.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined through construction documents submitted to the local building official showing detailed building data and features, and equipment systems governed under the code.  Variances and interpretations of the code are granted through the Department of Public Safety.  State statutes require the signature and seal of a licensed registered professional for all buildings of any use group (other than single-family residential [R-3] or agricultural) greater than 5,000 sq. ft. in floor area or of any use group A, E, or I of any size.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The State Building Inspector enforces compliance for state-owned buildings and local code officials enforce compliance for all other buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1979 legislation was passed requiring that the State Building and Fire Safety Codes (SBC) promote and ensure design and construction of energy-conserving buildings and the use of renewable resources.  In 1988 provisions were included in the enabling legislation requiring revision of the state building code no later than July 1989, in order to incorporate necessary 1988 BOCA International revisions into the state building code.  Furthermore, future revisions were limited to occur not more than every four years thereafter.<BR>

Compliance with the energy code is determined at the local level and varies depending on the county or locality.  Local government has the option of using alternative methods to ensure that commercial buildings less than 5,000 sq. ft. in floor area and residential buildings over three stories in height and less than 5,000 sq. ft. in floor area meet ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 requirements, as opposed to requiring certification by a licensed architect/engineer.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Enforcement is at the local level and left to code officials within the county or municipality.   The Department of Administrative Services is responsible for enforcing compliance for state-owned buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1979 the Delaware legislature passed Senate Bill 321, which established a minimum code for energy conservation. The legislation provided that no county or municipality may adopt a building or plumbing code that contradicts the energy requirements of the Model Code for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction (MCEC) (a model code based on ASHRAE/IES 90-1975.)  This legislation established the minimum provisions within the state but left it up to the counties and municipalities to adopt a code that fits within the guidelines outlined in the bill.  State legislation (Senate Bill 83) adopted the 1993 MEC statewide in 1995, as codified in Section 7602 of Title 16 of the Delaware Code.  The code became effective on July 1, 1996.<BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The DC Energy Conservation Code is updated regularly as the BOCA International code is revised or if a change is proposed by local code enforcement officials, industry, design professionals, or other interested parties.  Proposals are initiated by the District of Columbia Building Code Advisory Committee.  Proposals are published and public hearings are held.  The District of Columbia committee has final approval of all proposed code changes.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined by plan review and inspection.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Enforcement (all plan reviews, interpretations, and appeals) is the responsibility of the Building and Land Regulation Administration, which is a part of the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The District of Columbia (DC) Energy Conservation Code was based on the 1990 edition of the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Energy Conservation Code.  The District of Columbia Building Code Advisory Committee, along with the District of Columbia Energy Office, approved several amendments to the BOCA International, National Energy Conservation Code, particularly for interior and exterior lighting loads, power factor requirements, and energy-efficient motors.  These amendments were included in the district's requirements on November 27, 1992.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Chapter 13 of the FBC is the statewide uniform standard for energy efficiency in the thermal design and operation of all buildings in the state of Florida.  As such, the energy code is uniform throughout the state and cannot be made more lenient or stringent by local government.  It applies to all new buildings; additions to existing buildings and manufactured homes; renovations to existing buildings, both public and private, with certain exceptions; changes of occupancy type; and site-installed components and features of manufactured homes for initial setup.  New building systems added to existing buildings (heating, cooling, water heating) must also meet minimum code requirements. This does not include buildings for which federal mandatory standards preempt the state energy code.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The Florida Building Commission is directed to adopt, revise, update, and maintain the Florida Building Code in accordance with Chapter 120 of the state statutes.  The code is mandatory throughout the state and need not be adopted by a local government to be applicable at the local level.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

To obtain a building permit, the building owner or the owner's only designated agent must certify compliance.  If design and/or construction modifications are made that would diminish the building's energy performance, an amended compliance certification must be submitted to the local enforcement agency.  All work requiring a permit is subject to inspection by the local building official.  The builder must make available Energy Performance Level Display Cards, HVAC Efficiency Cards, and Insulation Certification Cards.  The building official must also forward a copy of the front page of the compliance certification to the Department of Community Affairs on a quarterly basis.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local building departments enforce compliance as part of the building regulatory programs.  Technical assistance is provided by the Department of Community Affairs.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In response to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Public Law 94-163), the 1977 Florida legislature passed two laws requiring local adoption of an energy code for certain building categories for which building permits were issued after March 15, 1979.  The two laws enacted by the Florida legislature were the driving force behind the "Florida Thermal Efficiency Code" and the "Florida Lighting Efficiency Code," which were combined in 1980 as the FEECBC.

<p>Originally, this state law referenced minimum standards for construction to meet or exceed national standards such as those of ASHRAE/IES 90-1975.  However, nationally recognized energy codes or standards such as ASHRAE standards were designed primarily for climates where heating, rather than cooling, is dominant.  The FEECBC was developed to be climate-specific for Florida.</p>

<p>The Florida legislature, through Chapter 81-226, Laws of Florida, and Chapter 553, Part VII, Florida Statutes, established the FEECBC.  The state must make any changes to the FEECBC through the Administrative Procedures Act process.</p>

<p>The Florida Building Commission (FBC) is responsibe for administering, modifying, revising, updating, and maintaining the code.  The DCA is  responsible for supporting the Florida Building Commission.  The code is revised on a three-year cycle, following ASHRAE and International Code Council (ICC) revision activities in addition to including criteria deemed appropriate for Florida.  The latest revision becomes effective on either July 1, 2001 or October 1, 2001, depending on legislative action.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>State amendments to ASHRAE 90.1 became effective April 1, 1997.  The code allows for an adjustment of the required roof/ceiling U-value when the roof surface has a solar reflectance greater than or equal to 0.75 per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 903 and infrared reflectance greater than or equal to 0.75 per ASTM 408.  The adjustment factor allows for an increased U value of 11% to 16% based on climate variations.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

A rule-making process is used to adopt new codes and to change existing codes.  When a proposed code change is forwarded to the Department of Community Affairs, it is first reviewed by a task force consisting of engineers, architects, builders, and contractors.  The task force evaluates the proposal and forwards it to the State Codes Advisory Committee if deemed appropriate.  The Advisory Committee also evaluates the proposal and submits it for public hearing.  If approved, the proposal is adopted by the Board of Community Affairs for inclusion into the next edition of the code.  The Department of Community Affairs is responsible for final rulemaking.  The Department of Community Affairs has a goal of revising the Georgia Energy Commission on a three-year cycle, but is not required to do so by law.  Thus, some revision cycles may be longer.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

A process to demonstrate compliance is not available in jurisdictions that are not enforcing codes.  In jurisdictions that are enforcing codes, compliance can be demonstrated during the plan review stage and verified by local inspection.  Some jurisdictions may accept the registered design professional's seal on a letter stating that the design conforms with the code.  Acceptance of such a letter is up to the local building official.  Disputes between owners, builders, or design professionals and the local building official can be taken to the local board of appeals for a hearing.  Descriptions of this process are provided in Chapter One of the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI).<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Georgia Energy Code (GEC) is one of eight mandatory minimum standard construction codes.  It has statewide application and is mandatory regardless of whether it is adopted or enforced by a local jurisdiction.  However, local units of government do enforce the code in jurisdictions that have elected to enforce the GEC.  The code is not enforced in jurisdictions that have not adopted the GEC; however, the designer and builder must still comply with the requirements.

<p>Local inspectors are hired by cities and counties.  The Department of Community Affairs provides training for inspectors through Clayton College and State University.  Attendance is not mandatory, and no state certification requirements exist for inspectors.  Certification of Building Officials through the SBCCI is voluntary.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The initial edition of the GEC was promulgated by the State Building Administration Board as authorized by Ga. L., 1978, p. 2212, which went into effect on July 16, 1978.  The code was based on both the Model Code for Energy Conservation, developed by the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  Funding to prepare and update this code was provided under a federal grant received through the Georgia Office of Energy Resources (OER) from the U.S. Department of Energy under Public Law 94-163. 

<p>Under Ga. L., 1980, p. 2859, the General Assembly transferred the functions, personnel, and equipment of the State Building Administration Board to the State Department of Community Affairs, effective July 1, 1980.  Since that time, the Department of Community Affairs has continued to maintain the GEC.  Until March 31, 1996, the GEC was based on the 1992 MEC and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 with state amendments.</p>

<p>The current GEC, which became effective April 1, 1996, adopts the 1995 MEC with state amendments.  The code is mandatory for all buildings, except those owned or leased in whole by the U.S. government.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Guam Building Energy Code, a cost-effective building energy code for Guam that meets or exceeds ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989 for commercial buildings and the 1992 Model Energy Code for residential buildings was adopted on May, 2000.   Enfrocement of the code began on November 15, 2000.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The UBC was adopted with provisions that allow the Guam Department of Public Works to administer the latest edition of the code.  Buildings under construction must comply with major safety issues, if practical.

<p>When the UBC is updated, the Guam Department of Public Works must notify all affected parties to comply with the updated version.  Guam amendments to the UBC must be published.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The Guam Department of Public Works requires that professional architects and engineers design plans for concrete structures.  A registered architect or engineer must stamp and sign plans for all commercial and multi-family buildings.  Building plans are submitted to the permitting office for review by all the government agencies for clearance.  The Guam Department of Public Works conducts plan reviews for all plans submitted for a building permit.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Guam Department of Public Works enforces the UBC for private and public buildings.  Engineers and architects conduct all plan reviews.  Trained and experienced building inspectors conduct field inspections.  Appeals to Department of Public Works decisions are heard by the Contractors Licensing Board.  Other appeals (not on Department of Public Works decisions) are heard by the Territorial Planning Commission.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The UBC was first adopted in 1979 by the 14th Guam Legislature.  Public Law 14-112 adopted Parts II through XII and appendices of the latest edition of the UBC and added these sections to the Guam Building Law.  The Guam Building Law was enacted in 1952 but only incorporated administrative provisions of the building code.  In 1980 Public Law 17-76 revised the building law and stated that whenever the UBC is updated, the Department of Public Works will automatically recognize the latest edition as the standard for design and construction.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>As of June 1999, three of Hawaii's four counties (Hawaii, Honolulu, and Kauai) have adopted the HMEC for high-rise (over three stories in height) residential and all commercial buildings.</p>

<p>HMEC provides criteria for non-air-conditioned residential buildings.  Most residences are not air-conditioned due to the mild climate.  Roof insulation is required for comfort.  Minimum roof insulation requirements are R-19 for dark roofs and R-5 radiant barriers for white roofs.</p>

<p>The code is applicable to all new and renovated commercial buildings used for human occupancy with a peak energy demand of greater than 1 watt per sq. ft., including state-owned buildings.  Exempt buildings include agricultural buildings, buildings used for industrial processing, and dwelling units with air-conditioning systems totaling less than 12,000 Btu/h capacity.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

No schedule exists for making statewide changes to the HMEC.  Each county reviews its code periodically.  If changes are deemed necessary on a statewide basis, the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism submits proposed legislation to the state legislature.  Following final passage, any new criteria becomes effective after an appropriate lead-in time.

<p>The county of Hawaii modified its adoption of the HMEC in April 1997, and includes residential buildings except duplexes and single-family residences (one- and two-family dwellings).</p>

<p>Changes to the code, initiated by a county government, will apply only at the local level for that individual county.  Once a change is initiated, a public review is required.  This process takes approximately six months to complete.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Low-rise residential buildings (for counties adopting the residential portion of the HMEC) may use a single prescriptive envelope path.  For other buildings, the three compliance paths used are those contained in ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  The computer program HiLight can be used to show compliance with the ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1993 lighting standards.  Plans are submitted when required by the County Public Works Department.  Local jurisdictions require that a registered architect or engineer review and stamp the plans and provide a written statement indicating compliance with the code requirements.  However, local jurisdictions still have the obligation to oversee the actual plans that are submitted during the established plan review functions.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

For all commercial buildings and all residential structures over three stories in height, field inspections by the County Public Works Department (Design & Construction Department in the city and county of Honolulu) are conducted during the established inspection process mandated by the building code.  No special procedures are required to enforce the energy requirements.

<p>Enforcement for state buildings is handled by the County Building Departments.  State buildings are specifically cited in the state law that mandated which counties must adopt the HMEC or equivalent.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first Hawaii energy code was based on ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  It was mandated by state legislation in 1978 and adopted by three of the four counties in the state in 1978 and 1979.  Although the law was mandated, there was no penalty provision.  In 1989 the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism hired a consultant to formulate standards for a new HMEC for commercial and residential structures.  The code was finalized in 1993.  The HMEC is based on ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 with modifications to accommodate Hawaii's climate.  Changes include the deletion of all space-heating requirements and changes in the building envelope and water-heating requirements.  In 1994 the legislature enacted Act 168 requiring counties to adopt efficiency requirements based on ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-1989 by October 24, 1994, for new and renovated commercial buildings.

<p>On August 8, 2001, the city and county of Honolulu, containing 80% of the state's population, adopted portions of ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and required R-19 or equivalent in new residential roofs.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>ASHRAE/IESNA 90A-80 and 90B-1975 for state-owned buildings.</p>

<p>HB 611 passed the legislature and was signed by the Governor April 17.  The bill, which takes effect July 1, 2000, requires that any jurisdiction that has adopted the UBC adopt the most current version of the code, which is now the 1997 UBC.  In the past, a jurisdiction adopting the UBC could elect to leave out the appendix that included the energy code.  Draft propsed legislation to adopt the 200 IBC and possibly the 2000 IECC is in the discussion stage at present time.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

A review process was added by SB 1208.  No more often than every three years, the Idaho Building Contractors Association, with advice and consent from the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, names representatives from the utilities and the building industry to a panel.  The panel will also include representatives from Idaho's cities and counties and the Idaho Department of Water Resources.  The panel reviews IRES and recommends changes to the Idaho legislature.  Cities, counties, and the Idaho Department of Water Resources can choose their own representatives to serve on the review panel.  The panel makes recommendations to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission who in turn makes recommendations to the state legislature.

<p>Cities and counties may, but are not required to, adopt energy standards for commercial buildings and may modify the residential standards to be more restrictive without state approval.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

For state-owned buildings, compliance pathways and requirements for submitting plans are those in the 1995 MEC.  All low-rise residential structures are required to comply with the IRES unless a local code exists that is more stringent.  Where IRES is applicable and the local jurisdiction is enforcing the standard, the builder must complete and submit a "Builder Certification of Compliance" form to the local jurisdiction to show compliance.  In jurisdictions that are not enforcing the code, builders must provide a self-certification to the home buyer and to the jurisdiction if requested.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

IRES is enforced through a self-certification from the building contractor.  In jurisdictions that are enforcing IRES, the builder must complete and submit a Builder Certification of Compliance to the local enforcement agency prior to obtaining a building permit.   Local jurisdictions may also require a plan review and building inspections during the construction process.  Utilities are no longer involved in IRES enforcement, and a utility hookup permit is no longer required.

<p>Enforcement varies depending on whether the jurisdiction chooses to enforce IRES, has and enforces its own energy code (local alternative energy code), or elects not to enforce an energy code.</p>

<p>For jurisdictions that enforce a local alternative energy code (meaning any local energy code that has different provisions than IRES), such as the Boise & Ada County Energy Code with the special electric resistance path, the Bannock County Energy Code, the MEC, and the Northwest Energy Code, the following apply:
<ul>
<li>The builder must comply with IRES and give Indoor Air Quality notice to purchaser or occupants.</li>
<li>The builder certification to jurisdiction is required.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction must supply builder certification forms.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may charge up to $25 for supplying certifications forms.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction must enforce the energy code the same way that it enforces its building code -- the means of enforcement is "without limitation" and no fees or fee limits are mentioned.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>For jurisdictions with local enforcement (meaning the local jurisdiction does not have an alternative energy code and enforces IRES with or without a local ordinance that adopts or refers to IRES), the following apply:
<ul>
<li>The builder must comply with IRES and give indoor air quality notice to purchaser or occupants.</li>
<li>The builder must certify compliance to potential purchasers.</li>
<li>The builder must certify compliance to the jurisdiction if requested.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may elect to provide IRES certification forms.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may charge up to $25 per form for certification forms.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may elect to provide IRES inspections.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may charge up to $50 for an IRES inspection.</li></ul></p>

<p>For jurisdictions with no local energy code enforcement (meaning the local jurisdiction does not have an alternative energy code and does not enforce IRES locally), the following apply:
<ul>
<li>The builder must comply with IRES and give indoor air Quality notice to purchaser or occupants.</li>
<li>The builder must certify compliance to potential purchasers.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may elect to provide IRES certification forms.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction may charge up to $25 per form for certification forms.</li></ul></p>

<p>Certification forms must be substantially the same as stated in 44-2304.  The stated form refers to a "U-Value Trade-Off Graph" listed in Box 3, but no graph or Box 3 is in the statute.  These references are to items in the old IRES rules and forms.  A local jurisdiction can customize the form and eliminate the "Alternate Prescriptive" lines if it chooses.</p>

<p>The builders are now included in the release from liability arising from indoor air quality if they "construct ..to the energy-efficient construction standards set forth in this chapter ," meaning at least the minimum envelope requirements, air leakage control, duct leakage, fireplace and stove measures, and ventilation requirements of 44-2302(1)(c).  Plus, builders may be required to prove the required indoor air quality notice was provided to the purchaser or occupants.  The notice that used to be in the rules is now in the statute.  It does not refer to carbon monoxide as a type of indoor air pollution.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

IRES (Senate Bill [SB] 1591) was enacted in 1990 and was the only legislated statewide energy code in Idaho.  However, it was a minimum standard and local jurisdictions could adopt more stringent energy codes.

<p>A 1994 state-sponsored analysis of new construction by jurisdiction and energy code indicated that approximately 38% of housing starts were built to IRES.  The five different energy codes listed below were used in the state as of late 1994:
<ul>
<li>Idaho Residential Energy Standard (IRES)</li>
<li>Northwest Energy Code (NEC), adopted by 46 jurisdictions</li>
<li>Bannock County Energy Code (BCEC), based on the NEC</li>
<li>Boise City and Ada County energy code, based on the NEC</li>
<li>IDWR's fuel-blind code for non electrically heated homes, adopted by Lewiston.</li></ul></p>

<p>Senate Bill 1208 was passed in March 1995 modifying the 1990 IRES to the 1996 IRES, which became effective January 1, 1996.  The 1996 IRES eliminates the requirement for builder certification to the Department of Labor and Industrial Services in cities or counties that have not adopted the IRES or an alternate code.</p><BR>

The primary energy conservation law in Illinois was the Illinois Public Utilities Act (revised in 1986.)  This law required Illinois investor-owned electric utilities to use least-cost energy planning, which required the use of economical energy conservation when new resources for electicity were required.  This requirement was implemented by utilities and monitored by the Illinois Commerce Commission through the least-cost energy planning process.  The requirement for utility energy conservation programs was in part the result of rate-payer frustration over the untimely and costly construction of several nuclear power plants in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The IECC is a mandatory minimum statewide code and may be modified to be more stringent by local government if first approved by the State Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission.  The IECC is mandatory for all heated and/or mechanically cooled residential and commercial construction (except agricultural), including new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs to state-owned and -operated buildings.</p>

<p>The state has begun rulemaking processes to adopt the 2000 IRC for class 2 buildings and 2000 IECC for class 1 buildings, both with state amendments.  The rulemaking process is expected to take about a year.  (BCAP May/June 2000)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the energy code are first processed through a technical advisory committee that reviews the current model code, considers the changes for adoption, and proposes changes to the code.  This process usually takes several months to a year to complete.  A financial impact analysis is submitted to the State Budget Agency for approval, and a "Notice of Intent to Adopt a Rule" is published in the Indiana Register for a period of 60 days.  The proposed model code with amendments is then submitted to the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission for approval to be published in the Indiana Register.  Following 75 days for public comment, the first public hearing is held by the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission, and the proposed rule is republished in the Indiana Register for an additional 45 days.  A second public hearing then takes place.  Changes are incorporated and approved by the Commission, and the final rule is sent to the State Attorney General and then the Governor for signature.  The maximum time allowed for review is 45 days for the Attorney General and an additional 30 days for the Governor.  If the changes are not reviewed in that time frame, it is automatically approved.  After final approval, and signing by the Governor, the rule is filed with the Secretary of State to become effective 30 days later.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance pathways and plan submittal requirements are those contained in the Indiana General Administrative Rules (GAR.)  All Class 1 buildings (buildings other than one- and two-family dwellings) require plans to be filed with the Indiana Department of Fire and Building Services, including an Application for Construction Design Release that requires energy design data.  Designs must be stamped by a licensed engineer or architect when required by the General Administrative Rules.  Some local jurisdictions require proof of compliance for Class 2 buildings (one- and two-family dwellings.)<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The state has established two building classes for energy code enforcement:  Class 2 (one- and two-family dwellings) and Class 1 (all other buildings.)  The local building official is responsible for the enforcement of the requirements for all one- and two-family dwellings (Class 2.)  Plans and specifications must be submitted when required by the building official.  Field inspections are performed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  The state provides cursory reviews of plans for all new nonresidential buildings and residential buildings other than one- and two-family dwellings (Class 1) and provides field inspections on buildings where no approved local building official exists.

<p>The State Building Commissioner is responsible for enforcement of the energy requirements for all Class 1 and Class 2 buildings that are industrialized building systems.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first statewide energy code was adopted December 1, 1979.  The code was based on the 1977 "Model Code for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction."   It applied to both residential and commercial structures.  Modifications to this code dealt with non technical administrative issues.  On October 1, 1984, a revised code, the IECC (1984 edition), became effective statewide.  This code was based on the 1983 MEC with state amendments and applied to all residential and commercial construction.

<p>On December 31, 1992, the IECC (1992 edition) became effective.  This code is based on the 1992 MEC with state amendments and is applicable to all residential and commercial structures.  The HVAC requirements were updated to comply with the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act.  The electrical power and lighting requirements of the 1979 code were retained.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Amendments to MEC:<ul>
<li>For one- and two-family detached buildings, the state code requires the use of the Home Heating Index (HHI) based on the building envelope energy loss with a code-defined correction factor based on the site heating degree-days, in addition to compliance with the MEC.  The HHI is defined as "per square foot of floor area."</li>
<li>Equipment oversizing is limited to 130% of the design heating load and 115% of the design cooling load.</li></ul>

<p>Lighting efficiency standards of the state building code are applicable to new construction owned by the state, an agency of the state, or a political subdivision of the state, and all new construction of buildings that are open to the general public during normal working hours.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The state energy code is reviewed on a three-year code cycle corresponding to publication of the MEC.  Written requests for changes to the state energy code can be submitted to the state Building Code Bureau.  All suggested code revisions are processed through the state administrative rule-making process involving publication, public comments, and public hearings.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Residential:  For one- and two-family dwellings, the local utility company must obtain a written statement/certification from the builder or homeowner attesting to their compliance with the state energy code.

<p>Commercial:  ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 provides three compliance approaches -- the Energy Cost Budget method, the System Performance approach, and the Prescriptive approach.  The Energy Cost Budget method allows for considerable trade-offs of building components.  The System Performance approach provides for trade-offs within the building envelope and within the interior lighting provisions.  The Prescriptive approach allows for very limited trade-offs within the fenestration category only.  For buildings with over 100,000 cubic feet of heated or cooled space, a registered engineer or architect must review plans and calculations.  A standardized compliance form supplied by the Building Code Bureau is completed by the engineer or architect and is submitted to the Bureau for approval.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

No special inspections are required to demonstrate energy compliance except those done in conjunction with customary local department building inspections.

<p>In areas where a local or state building code has been adopted, the local jurisdiction is responsible for review and inspection of all buildings that have less than or equal to 100,000 cubic feet of conditioned volume.  When required by the building official, plans and specifications must be submitted.  Where required by the local enforcement agency, plans must be stamped by registered architects and engineers.  Field inspections are performed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  Certification to the state using the state-furnished compliance form is required.</p>

<p>Before electrical hook-up for one- and two-family dwellings, the local utility company requires a statement of review based on compliance with the HHI, issued by the state or the local enforcement agency.  A 1995 study (Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Company) of new homes in Iowa City found that 93% of the new homes did not meet the MEC.  In addition, the Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities found in 1995 that only 9% of Iowa communities enforce the MEC.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1972 the General Assembly of the state of Iowa passed House File 6, an Act to institute an Iowa building code to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.  House File 6 became known as Iowa Code Chapter 103A.  The first energy code was established in 1978, based on the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards Model Code for Energy Conservation.  Since that time, the Iowa building code has been updated based on the latest edition of the MEC, but with minor state modifications.  The state of Iowa had adopted the 1991 editions of the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, and Uniform Plumbing Code, and the 1990 National Electrical Code.  At that time, the 1989 Council of American Building Officials One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code had been adopted as an option to the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, and Uniform Plumbing Code and was usable when permitted by a governmental subdivision of the state that has adopted the state building code.

<p>A Notice of Intended Action was published by the state on November 1, 1996, that proposed eliminating insulation requirements for basements.  Written comments were due December 11, 1996, and public hearings were held the next day.  The Building Code Commissioner, with advice from an advisory council, determined the proposed action should not be adopted.</p>

<p>In May 1997 legislation was passed by the Iowa General Assembly (IA RSA 103A) to limit the application of the 1992 MEC to only state-, county-, and city-owned structures and to construction in jurisdictions that have adopted the state building code.  The legislation was vetoed on May 29, 1997, by Governor Terry Branstad.</p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Legislative action would be required to amend the code adopted by the state.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The statewide energy standards require an energy efficiency disclosure by the builder or seller of new residential buildings to the buyer.  The disclosure provides the energy attributes of the structure.  The MECcheck compliance materials developed by the U.S. Department of Energy are one of several ways to show compliance with the 1993 MEC.  No formal plan review or construction inspection is required.  The potential for litigation exists as a way to ensure compliance for commercial and industrial buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local jurisdictions do not enforce the statewide energy standards.  The state conducts enforcement activities for state-owned buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

During the 1975, 1976, and 1977 legislative sessions, both the Kansas Legislative Special Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Kansas House Committee on Energy and Natural Resources considered bills that would have enacted statewide building codes addressing energy efficiency.  These legislative attempts failed, and in 1977 the House Committee abandoned an attempt to pass a bill in favor of allowing the KCC to address the issue in a Show Cause Order issued under Docket 110,766-U.  Thermal standards as well as air-conditioning equipment efficiency were subsequently adopted by the Kansas Corporation Commission order in September 1977 under Docket 110,766-U.  Under the order, each electric and gas utility under the jurisdiction of the KCC was to require a certificate of compliance with the adopted standards from the owner of each newly constructed residential or commercial building before the utility could provide permanent service.

<p>The thermal standards (maximum heat loss as a function of floor area) adopted at that time presented a problem because not all electric and gas utilities were under KCC's jurisdiction.  To address that concern, the 1978 legislative session adopted Kansas Statutes Annotated 66-131a, HB 2698, giving the KCC jurisdiction over municipal electric and natural gas utilities to restrict connections to buildings not meeting the standards.</p>

<p>Gas utilities were only required to ensure compliance with the insulation requirements of the order, while electric utilities were required to ensure compliance with both the insulation and air-conditioning equipment efficiency requirements.   In 1979 the legislature approved the adoption of Kansas Administrative Regulation 27-2-1, establishing maximum lighting efficiency standards for public buildings.</p>

<p>The thermal standards were in effect for all Kansas electric and natural gas utilities until 1992.  The 1992 legislative session adopted Kansas Statutes Annotated 66-104d, SB 435, which allowed electric cooperatives the option of deregulation.  Since that time, some electric utilities have exercised this option and are no longer under KCC's jurisdiction.  Other than the jurisdictional modification in 1992, there have been no revisions or updates to the statewide energy standards adopted under the order since 1980.  Some of the larger cities and counties did establish and enforce their own energy standards.</p>

<p>The KCC formally adopted the 1993 MEC and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 on January 23, 1996.  Formal orders were to be issued within 60 days following adoption.  Utilities under KCC authority were given 12 months to implement the new order.</p>

<p>HB 2707 was introduced in 1996 and would have eliminated KCC's authority to adopt and enhance energy efficiency standards for residential construction.  This bill was not enacted in 1996.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 74 introduced in 1997 proposed to eliminate KCC's authority to adopt or enforce residential energy standards, thereby repealing the 1993 MEC for residential construction.  This bill died in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 1, 1997.</p>

<p>House Bill (HB) 2140 was introduced in 1997 to repeal the 1993 MEC and KCC's authority to adopt and enforce residential energy standards.  It also required disclosure to the buyers of new homes of the R-values and U-values of installed insulation, windows and doors, and all HVAC and water heating equipment efficiencies to new home buyers.  The bill was defeated.</p>

<p>On April 24, 1997, Kansas Governor Bill Graves signed legislation (SB 333) to retain the 1993 MEC for residential construction referenced in the state energy efficiency policy.  In addition, Section 17 of SB 333 adopted ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 (standard or code) for new commercial and industrial structures, although it did not define "commercial" or "industrial."  The legislature, through Section 17, also assumed authority for building energy standards from the KCC.  Both the 1993 MEC and ASHRAE 90.1-1989 are mandatory throughout the state.  SB 333 retains the authority of local government to adopt and enforce standards that are more stringent than the state standards.</p>

<p>The KCC is still responsible for commercial and residential energy code training and educational seminars.</p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The KBC (KBC) is updated every three years on a cycle one year behind the publication year for the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International.  Any changes to the code by the state of Kentucky are submitted to the Board of  Housing for review by the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction Division of Building Codes Enforcement.  The changes are approved in this forum and are forwarded to the Legislative Research Committee for public comment and further review.

<p>The board evaluates the KBC every three years.  During the three-year cycle, proposed changes to the KBC may be submitted for consideration and voted upon by the board.  No scheduled code change process is in force; the process is triggered when proposals are submitted.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction Division of Building Codes and Enforcement is responsible for complying with code changes and amendments.  Once changes and amendments are adopted and entered as part of the state requirements, they become state law by the state statute.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance with the KBC is determined by plan review by either the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction or local jurisdictions.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local jurisdictions are required to follow the statewide energy provisions and are not allowed to reference or enforce any other standard or code other than the KBC.  The exception to this requirement is that jurisdictions may enforce the Council of American Building Officials One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code as an alternative method of compliance when the scope of coverage has been extended to include homes that are not trade-name or brand-name homes.
  
<p>Compliance with the energy provisions are verified through a plan review and field inspections by the local code officials.  Formal interpretations of the code are made by Mr. Jack Rhody, Chief Building Official with the Division of Building Codes Enforcement.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The KBC became a minimum statewide requirement on February 15, 1980, for all buildings over three stories in height, in excess of 20,000 square feet and intended for assembly, educational, institutional, or high hazard occupancy or business or industrial occupancies in excess of 100 occupants.  In steps, the KBC became effective for all buildings, and by August 15, 1982, the code was applied throughout the entire state of Kentucky.

<p>Effective July 1, 1994, the state of Kentucky mandated compliance with the 1994 KBC, which is based on the 1993 BOCA International National Building Code (NBC), and therein adopted the 1992 MEC.</p>

<p>Effective July 1, 1997, the state of Kentucky mandated compliance with the 1997 KBC, which is based on the 1996 BOCA International NBC.  One of the amendments they made to the 1996 NBC was to modify Chapter 13 to reference the 1992 MEC as opposed to the 1995 MEC referenced in the 1996 NBC.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Multifamily residential construction three stories or less in height must comply with the 1995 MEC.  Local jurisdictions are free to adopt any criteria they choose for other residential construction.  The state rules or regulations do not include a residential energy code.</p>

<p>The state's commercial building energy code applies to all new commercial buildings and major alterations and repairs to existing buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Adoption is through legislation for commercial buildings and local ordinance for Use Group R-3.  Local government is allowed to adopt only the state commercial energy code.

<p>The Office of the State Fire Marshal is granted the authority to promulgate amendments, revisions, and alternative compliance methods for the code.  Once promulgated, they would replace the existing code.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The Office of the State Fire Marshal has authority to enforce the code for commercial buildings statewide except state-owned commercial buildings.  Plans, specifications, and energy code compliance documents must be submitted to and reviewed by the State Fire Marshal.  The submitter will receive a letter from the State Fire Marshal indicating whether the documents demonstrate compliance.  Receipt of the letter cannot delay the State Fire Marshal's normal project review process, nor the ability of a local building department to issue a building permit or use and occupancy permit.  Parties receiving a letter of non compliance can resubmit revised plans and will be issued another letter notifying them of compliance or non compliance.  Any compliance letters must be kept at the building site and the owners must retain the letter once the structure is occupied.

<p>For state-owned facilities, the Facility Planning and Control Section of the Division of Administration has authority.  They must determine that plans, specifications, and energy code compliance documents comply with the code, as well as all alterations and repairs.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The State Fire Marshal and Facility Planning and Control  Section of the Division of Administration have authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to enforce the provisions of the legislation.  These rules and regulations are currently being formulated.  A local government may adopt and enforce its own commercial building energy conservation code; however, it must be the state's commercial building energy conservation code.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The state adopted the 1991 Standard Building Code (SBC) statewide and any future revisions to the SBC.  Appendix E of this code (dealing with energy in buildings) was not adopted, but cities and parishes could adopt this portion of the code.  Appendix E required adherence to the 1989 MEC with an option to use ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for buildings other than residential buildings three stories high or less, and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980 for residential buildings three stories high or less.

<p>During the 1997 regular session of the legislature, Senate Bill No. 1167 was passed and enacted.  This act created a new Part IV-B of Chapter 8 of Title 40 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes.  The purpose of the legislation is to institute minimum energy conservation standards  for all new commercial construction and all applicable alterations and repairs in commercial buildings.  The legislation was passed in June 1997, signed by the governor on July 14, 1997, and became effective on January 1, 1999.  The legislation also establishes requirements for education and training and an Advisory Committee.</p><BR>

<P><B>Commercial Energy Code is mandatory statewide:</B><BR>

	Not Available<BR>


<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Energy Efficiency Building Performance Standards (EEBPS) are statewide minimum energy efficiency requirements that all new construction and additions to existing buildings must satisfy.  Exceptions include single-family homes built by an owner-builder (which includes anyone supervising the construction of that person's single-family dwelling or a general contractor hired to supervise the construction) and log homes.  As a result, the code only affects about 5% of new residential construction.  The commercial requirements apply to all new commercial and institutional construction.  Manufacturing facilities are exempt.</p>

<p>Publicly subsidized multi-family residential buildings are prohibited from installing electric resistance heat unless they are built to state-developed, super-insulated standards.  Commercial and institutional new construction must comply with the current version of ASHRAE 90 (ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1999.)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The statewide energy requirements may be modified or changed by legislative action at the state level.  Those changes may be proposed whenever the legislature is in session.  The Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) may adopt rules to define terms used in the legislation and to clarify the intent of the energy code.  In some instances, the legislature has granted specific authority for the DECD to adopt rules within a well-defined scope.  The law automatically adopts the current version of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1 for the commercial and institutional energy code.  Local municipalities may adopt either the statewide requirements or another more restrictive standard.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

New commercial and institutional construction must conform to the current ASHRAE 90.1-1999 standard using any of the ASHRAE compliance paths.  No state-required plan reviews or permits are required.  All commercial construction must be designed by an architect or engineer, and it is suggested that local code officials look for certification of compliance.  Prior to installing permanent electrical service, the owner, or the owner's legal agent, of commercial or institutional buildings constructed after October 13, 1993, must certify that the building complies with the energy standards.  

<p>The building contractor and owner are encouraged to have a contract but may agree not to have one.  Residential building contractors must sign a contract for any work over $1,400.  One provision of the contract is to state whether or not the building complies with the minimum energy efficiency standards.  No notifications or compliance documents are submitted to the state.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Energy Conservation Division of the DECD is responsible for administering and enforcing the energy requirements.  If the building owner does not comply with these requirements, then a penalty equaling up to 5% of the value of the building may be enforced.  The DECD may review plans and inspect for compliance; however, limited funding and staff have prevented plan reviews and inspections.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1977 the state legislature adopted what is now Chapter 57 of the Private and Special Laws, which directed the Office of Energy Resources (OER) to establish the Maine Commission on Energy Efficiency Building Performance Standards (the Commission.)  The Commission was directed to investigate energy building standards and make recommendations to the next biennial legislature. 

<p>In 1979 PL 503, "The Energy Building Performance Standards Act," established 10 MRSA, Chapter 214, which directed the OER to adopt voluntary energy standards for residential and commercial new construction and substantial renovations.  The Act also established the Advisory Council on Energy Efficiency Building Performance Standards, which was empowered to approve all rules promulgated under Chapter 214.</p>

<p>The OER and the Commission recommended standards that were approved as the "Energy Conservation Building Standards."  The standards applied to all buildings offered for sale or lease that were promoted as meeting these standards.  It was the responsibility of the OER to administer and enforce the standards.</p>

<p>In 1980 the legislature adopted the voluntary standards into law.</p>

<p>In 1985 the legislature required that the OER establish mandatory standards for all publicly funded buildings and maintain voluntary standards for all other buildings.  The Advisory Council appointed a Task Force on Energy Efficiency Building Standards to recommend current standards.  New standards based on ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980 and ASHRAE/IES Standard 90B-1975 were approved effective January 1, 1987.</p>

<p>Effective January 1, 1989, a state law established statewide minimum standards for some residential and all commercial and institutional new construction.  Residential buildings were required to be insulated to prescribed levels.  Commercial and institutional buildings were required to meet the current version of ASHRAE 90.</p>

<p>Effective January 1, 1990, the Office of Energy Resources was closed and its responsibilities and some of the staff transferred to the DECD.</p><BR>

<p>Effective September 1, 1997, the MBPS refer to the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International 1996 National Building Code (NBC).  Chapter 13 of the 1996 NBC adopts by reference the 1995 Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC.)  The 1995 MEC adopts by reference ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<p>All new construction, additions, and alterations to existing buildings must comply with the code.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing and Community Development has developed CODE LYNX, a computer database that provides easy access to the Maryland Building Performance Standards (MBPS) and the BOCA National Fire Prevention Code via the internet.  CODE LYNX allows users to search for any topic in the MBPS and Fire Code and to compare the BOCA based MBPS with amendments to those standards by local jurisdictons.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 64 passed both the Senate and the House and was signed by the Governor April 25, 2000.  On January 1, 2001, the 2000 International Building Code, including the 2000 IECC, became effective.  (BCAP July/August 2001).</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The MBPS is updated every three years corresponding to the BOCA International code change cycle.  When BOCA International updates its codes, Maryland will automatically adopt the new version.  Local jurisdictions may alter the code as long as the requirements are more restrictive than the adopted state code.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The MBPS is mandatory statewide.  Builders must demonstrate compliance to local government (cities, counties) that have adopted the code.  In cities and counties that have not adopted the code, the builder must certify code compliance to the serving electric utility as a condition for electrical service.

<p>Upon request, the Department of Housing and Community Development will provide certification forms to the local utility companies, builders, and local code officials.</p>

<p>Building professionals used MECcheck and COMcheck-EZ materials to show compliance.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The state code is enforced by local jurisdictions that have adopted the code through plan review and inspections.  In areas that have not adopted the code, a certification form filled out by the builder is required to show compliance.  The local utility must evaluate the building prior to providing electrical service.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1981 Maryland passed the Energy Conservation Building Standards Act, which established the MBPS requiring statewide conformance to the current edition of the BOCA NBC.  The Act established a limited role for the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.  The Act also grants them rulemaking authority to amend the MBPS through publications in the Maryland register and subsequent hearings on administrative actions.

<p>Prior to the most recent action, the MBPS referred to the 1993 BOCA International NBC.  Chapter 13 of the 1993 NBC adopts by reference the 1993 MEC.  In addition, the 1993 NBC allows conformance with ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-75 for single-family dwellings and multi-family residential buildings not over three stories high as an alternative to the MEC.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing and Community Development published a notice to update the MBPS in the Maryland Register on January 13, 1997.  They proposed to adopt the 1996 NBC, with amendments, into the MBPS.  In its Notice, the Department of Housing and Community Development did not propose to modify anything in the 1996 NBC relating to "energy."</p>

<p>Comments on the proposal were to be submitted to the Department of Housing and Community Development.  No public hearings were scheduled (three relevant hearings were held in the summer of 1996.)  That proposal was administratively adopted in April 1997.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Provisions requiring a maximum U-value of .44 and NFRC labeling for low-rise residential replacement windows became effective January 1, 1999.</p>

<p>The state of Massachusetts developed a  new commercial code that includes elements from both the revised ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1R and the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC).  The code was adopted July 13, 1999 with an effective date of January 19, 2001.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Code amendment cycles occur twice a year, as required by statute, and include a public hearing process.  The Board of Building Regulations Standards has sole authority to promulgate the Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC).  Anyone can submit code change proposals to the Board.  Adopted code changes are typically promulgated during the year of adoption.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined at the local level by local building inspectors as part of an application review and inspection process.  Compliance is addressed in three distinct ways:  1) registered architects and engineers at the design level are charged by state law and regulations with abiding by design criteria of the code,  2) the construction community is equally charged with abiding by the code, and 3) the building officials review the submitted plans and complete inspections prior to issuing the certificate of compliance.  Compliance paths include both prescriptive and performance approaches.

<p>Building professionals can use MAScheck to show compliance for residential buildings and  COMcheck-EZ for commercial buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Enforcement is through the local building inspectors of the 351 cities and towns of the Commonwealth.  Only a Building Code Board of Appeals, consisting of specified technical members, may grant a variance to the code.  Plan review and construction inspection, although performed by the local building official, is also required of the engineers/architects of record when buildings exceed 35,000 cubic feet of interior volume.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

By statue, the uniform MSBC has been the single, legal statewide building code since January 1, 1975.  The MSBC applies to all new construction and certain work in existing buildings.  The energy provisions in the MSBC were developed by the Board's Energy Advisory Committee, working with staff supported by a federal grant from USDOE, and with additional support from the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources which administers utility rebate programs and establishes state energy policy.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Michigan Uniform Energy Code Part 10 Rules were adopted March 31, 1999.  In accordance with Public Act 230 of 1972, the state energy code must be enforced statewide without exception.  Under these rules, residential buildings must comply with the prescriptive requirements or one of the alternative analysis methods contained in the rules.  These rules do no apply to alterations and additions to residential buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The state energy code is evaluated for revisions or modifications every three years.  The new code requirements are adopted at the beginning of each state building code cycle (which corresponds with the three-year cycle of the Building Officials and Code Administrators [BOCA] International, National Building Code [NBC].)<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined by plan review and inspection by the local code official or state building official.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The local code official is designated to enforce the state energy requirements.  Enforcement is completed through plan review and inspections.  The Bureau of Construction Codes, Department of Consumer and Industry Services, interprets the code and enforces it in those jurisdictions in which the Bureau has enforcement responsibilities.

.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Prior to June 22, 1977, the state of Michigan had no building energy efficiency requirements.  As of that date, the state adopted ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975 statewide.  On July 27, 1985, the state adopted ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980 statewide.

<p>SB 719, signed in early January 1996, repealed the 1995 adoption of the 1993 MEC.  The legislation directed the state construction code commission to, by April 1, 1997, provide cost-effective standards and establish a program to provide home buyers with energy rating information.  A 10-member ad hoc committee was established to assist with these efforts.</p>

<p>The Michigan Uniform Energy Code Part 10 Rules were adopted March 31, 1999.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Minnesota State Building Code is a mandatory statewide  code for all residential and commercial construction, including state-owned and operated buildings that are constructed, altered, and repaired.  Specific counties and certain incorporated cities with a population of over 2,500 must adopt and enforce the state code.</p>

<p>A statewide construction codes advisory council  is considering changes that might be recommended for legislative consideration.  The areas they are looking into include:<ul>

<li>Statewide enforcement and appeals process</li>
<li>Requirements for standardization of permit fees and fee dispersement</li>
<li>Ways to facilitate construction of healthier homes</li>
<li>Code adoption coordination</li></ul></p>

<p>New energy code rules are in effect for commercial and high rise residential building permits beginning July 20, 1999.  They are contained in Minnesota Rules Chapters 7676 and 7678 (see Dept. of Commerce web site Energy Code page for complete information).</p>

<p>New energy code rules are in effect for residential building permits beginning April 15, 2000.  They apply to detached single-family and two-family dwellings (classified as Group R, Division 3 Occupancies).  The 2000 Minnesota legislature also gave builders an alternative to the new rules:  instead of following Chapter 7672, they can meet the provisions of Minnesota Rules 7670 (the energy code adopted in 1994) that apply to Category 1 buildings, plus some additional requirements regarding ventilation and heating and exhaust systems.  This option provides fewer alternative methods for achieving compliance and is less prescriptive than 7672, relying more on individual interpretations and judgments.  It gives the builder greater responsibility for ensuring the quality of the finished product.  For remodeling and multi-family homes, the builder must comply with either Chapter 7672 or 7670.  (If 7670 rules are followed, the additional ventilation and other mechanical requirements do not apply.)  (See Dept. of Commerce web site Energy Code page for complete information.)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

In 1999 the Minnesota legislature transferred authority for adopting the state's energy code from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Administration Building Codes and Standards Division.   Additional changes to the code may be mandated by the state legislature.  Anyone can submit changes to the Energy Division staff for consideration.  The Building Codes and Standards Division wil review new model codes for adoption with amendments appropriately on a three year cycle.  The Administrative Procedure Act provides procedures that require a formal public hearing only if requested by 25 or more individuals.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

All residential structures in areas that have adopted and enforce the code are required to comply with the state residential energy code.  The compliance pathways are those outlined in the MEC.  Envelope U-value compliance can be demonstrated using MNcheck.

<p>All commercial structures and high-rise residential buildings in areas that have adoted and enforce the code are required to comply with the state commercial energy code using one of three compliance paths.  Requirements to submit plans for review and requirements for stamping by a registered engineer or architect are the same as those required in the MEC.  Complaince can be demonstrated using COMcheck-MN.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

In 1979 individual counties outside of the seven-county Minneapolis/St. Paul area and incorporated cities with populations of less than 2,500 were given the option of enforcing a statewide building code.  Many elected to have no enforcement within their area.  Currently enforcement occurs for about 80% of the population base; approximately 20% of the population has no enforced energy code. 

<p>Plans and specifications must be submitted.  In addition to the MECcheck list, plans must also show the location of interior air barriers, vapor barriers, and wind wash barriers as well as air sealing requirements.  Some plans must be stamped by a registered design professional as required by the state statute.  The code establishes minimum submittal requirements concerning R-values, equipment efficiencies, and lighting components.  Field inspections are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  Field inspections are performed as part of the normal building inspection process.</p>

<p>For buildings not inspected by the State Department of Administration, interpretations are made at the local level.  Disagreements may be forwarded to a local appeals board.  The Department of Commerce is frequently asked for an opinion, but has no enforcement authority.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

A state law was enacted in 1975 to require building design and construction standards consistent with the most efficient use of energy.  In response, an energy code became effective on January 30, 1976, as part of the state building code.  The energy code was revised in 1977 and 1978 to incorporate ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-75 requirements.  The energy code was revised in 1984 to adopt the 1983 MEC and the insulation provisions of the HUD Minimum Property Standards for residential construction (including foundation wall insulation for residential buildings).  A 1991 revision adopted the 1989 MEC.  Statutes were enacted in 1991 setting higher goals for the energy code.  One statute required that the energy code requirements for commercial buildings be at least as stringent as ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  Another statute specified that the lighting standards be at least as stringent as the "current" requirements for new federal buildings (10 CFR Part 435.)  (Note:  this statute was repealed in 1999 with the legislation discussed below.)

<p>Since 1991, emphasis has been on code amendments related to the air tightness of buildings, wind wash barriers, and other provisions to ensure performance of installed thermal insulation and durability of structural elements.  Code revisions adopted June 1994 provided for minimum criteria for residential buildings (termed Category 2), and an optional higher criteria (termed Category 1.)  All commercial buildings, and residential buildings over three stories in height, were required to meet a state amended version of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  One- and two-family dwellings, and multi-family residential buildings three stories or less in height, were required to meet a state code based on the 1992 MEC.</p>

<p>Changes were adopted for the commercial building energy code (Minn. Rules Chapters 7676 and 7678) on November 4, 1997.  These revisions, which became effective July 20, 1999,  provide minimum criteria for energy efficiency standards for commercial buildings.</p>

<p>In 1999 legislation (Laws of Minn. 1999, Chapter 135) passed that transferred the authority for rule-making to the Minnesota Department of Administration, Building Codes and Standards Division.   Laws of Minnesota 2000 Chapter 407 gives builders an alternative to the new rules:  instead of following Chapter 7672, they can meet the provisions of Minnesota Rules 7670 (the energy code adopted in 1994) that apply to Category 1 buildings, plus some additional requirements regarding ventilation and heating and exhaust systems (see Dept. of Commerce web site Energy Code page for complete information.)</p><BR>

<p>The existing state code is based on the 1977 Model Code for Energy Conservation (MCEC.)  New codes based on ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 and the 1995 MEC are being considered.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Mississippi has no set schedule to update their energy code. 

<p>State Level:  Anyone may submit legislation.  It must pass through committee and be voted upon by both chambers of the legislature.  Before becoming a law, the governor must sign the legislation.  The existing law does not mandate enforcement by localities, and any revised code will probably require adoption by local jurisdictions.  To adopt the code at the local level, the local government must adopt it through a vote of the city council or county commission.  Depending on the form of government, the mayor may be required to sign the law.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance for state-owned buildings is verified by the Bureau of Building.  Other buildings are subject to enforcement by local authorities.  For state-owned or -funded buildings, the Bureau of Building reviews plans and specifications to ensure compliance.  For other buildings in jurisdictions that have adopted the state code, plan reviews and inspections are typically used to show compliance through the normal permit process.  After successfully completing this process, the building department issues a certificate of occupancy.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

For state-owned and -funded buildings, the design professional works with the building commission to establish compliance.  For other buildings, local units of government enforce the code through the normal inspection process.  If local governments adopt the energy provisions of the Standard Building Code (SBC) (Appendix E of the SBC), enforcement is then accomplished through the permit/inspection process for new construction and additions.  Depending on the size of the local government unit, the same individual may be responsible for performing plan reviews and inspections.

<p>As of mid-1998, 20 of the state's 82 counties have adopted the current edition of the SBC.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Beginning July 1, 1980, the design, direction, construction, and alteration of any building was required to satisfy Chapter 39 of 57-39-21 Energy Efficiency Standards for Buildings (a state energy code based on the 1997 MCEC.)  The state does not allocate money for municipalities to hire inspectors.  The utilities have some incentives for insulation and increased efficiency equipment.  Attempts to update the code to the 1992 and 1993 MEC failed to pass the legislature in 1994 and 1997, respectively.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Missouri does not have a statewide building or energy code.  Each local jurisdiction has the authority to adopt its own code.  In most cases, local jurisdictions have adopted the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Building Code (NBC), although the western part of the state has adopted the International Conference Building Officials (ICBO), Uniform Building Code (UBC) and a few localities in the southeast use the Southern Building Code Congress, International (SBCCI) Standard Building Code (SBC).</p>

<p>Missouri General Assembly passed a bill that would allow the county commission of any county to adopt a building code subject to voter approval.  In creating or amending such code, a current calendar year 1999 or later edition nationally recognized building code must be adopted.  (Section 64.180, RSMo).</p>

<p>The Governor's commission for the Review and Formulation of Building Code Implementation presented its recommendations to the Governor on December 1, 1999.  They include recommendations:<ul>

<li>To allow third class counties to be given the authority to adopt a building code.</li>
<li>To require all jurisdictions already operating pursuant to an adopted model building code to update its code so that it is current within one model code edition of the latest such code published by that model code organization.</li>
<li>To require the family of International Codes to be the codes adopted when those areas that do not have codes decide to adopt codes.</li>
<li>That the Legislature pass legislation to create a Missouri Building Code Review Commission to provide advice to the Governor and Legislature on building code issues affecting the state.</li></ul></p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Legislation established the energy requirements for state-funded buildings.  Legislation will be required to adopt a mandatory statewide energy code.  Local jurisdictions may adopt their own energy code.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance for state-funded buildings is demonstrated through plan review and inspections by the Missouri Office of Administration, Division of Design and Construction.  Compliance at the local level (if any) is through plan review and inspection by local building officials.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Missouri Office of Administration, Division of Design and Construction enforces the requirements for state-funded buildings.  The local jurisdiction enforces any locally adopted code requirements.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1993 the Missouri General Assembly passed two legislative proposals that address energy efficiency in state facilities.  Implementation of the Energy Efficiency in State Facilities Program is currently under way.  

<p>The state of Missouri has no authority to adopt or enforce locally preemptive building standards for residential or commercial (non state) buildings.  This authority remains at the local level.  The Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Division of Energy, conducted a survey of local units of government in 1994. This survey helped the Division determine what percentage of Missouri's population is operating under a building code and if energy efficiency is a part of the code.  The survey was administered to local political subdivisions, which included all Missouri counties and municipalities with populations of 500 or more.</p>

<p>The Division of Energy distributed a summary of the 1994 building code survey to members of the Missouri Committee for Model Codes and other stakeholders.  The summary showed that those cities and counties responding to the survey that had building codes in place represented 47% of the state's population.  Approximately 28% of the population is not covered by a building code and the remaining cities and counties representing approximately 25% of the population did not respond to the survey.</p>

<p>In 1994 a legislative proposal that would authorize the state to establish a state building code was introduced.  The legislative initiatives focused primarily on establishing construction codes designed to prevent the structural failure of buildings rather than to ensure energy efficiency.  Another consideration was that federal flood relief for reconstruction be withheld from property owners living in localities that did not require building permits.  Although the proposal and subsequent versions came to a vote six times, it did not pass.  The last version of the bill would have created a State Building Code Advisory Board consisting of 17 members to study the need for a statewide building code and to make recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly.  The Board was to have been dissolved in less than a year.</p>

<p>Similar legislation was introduced during the 1995 legislative session.  The Division of Energy coordinated a meeting on August 24, 1994, with Representative Boucher, State Office Administration staff, the Kansas City Regional Office of the Department of Energy, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to discuss including energy efficiency provisions in the 1995 legislative proposal.  Several options were presented based on initiatives in other states.  The 1995 legislative proposal would have required counties to adopt and enforce a building code:  either the BOCA UBC or the SBCCI SBC.  The bill did not require energy codes as stringent as those required by EPAct.  The bill died in the legislature.  Similar legislation failed in the 1996 session.</p>

<p>An interim committee was formed during the summer of 1995 to study the need for state building codes.  To gather public input on the need for statewide building codes, the interim committee scheduled four regional meetings across the state.</p>

<p>In response to legislation signed in 1993, for Energy Efficiency in State Facilities, a rule was finalized and published on January 26, 1996, with an effective date 30 days later that established "state building minimum efficiency standards."  The rule covers new state buildings (or portions), additions, substantial renovations, or existing buildings considered for lease (when over 10,000 sq. ft.) or acquisition by the state.  ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 is adopted by reference for buildings other than single-family and multi-family residential buildings not over three stories high.  For single-family and multi-family residential buildings, the latest editions of the Council of American Building Officials Model Energy Code (MEC) or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 90.2-1993 is applicable.  New editions/revisions to these adopted standards are automatically adopted by reference and become effective three months after the date of their publication.  (10 CSR 140-7, Department of Natural Resources.)  No statewide requirements exist for other buildings; local cities and jurisdictions adopt their own requirements.</p>

<p>During the 1999 legislative session, Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 was approved by the Missouri Legislature.  The resolution notes that three model code groups have combined to formulate a single code entitled the International Building Code that is to be published in April 2000.  The resolution states the need for study and evaluation of alternatives and strategies available for implementation.</p>

<p>To address this need, the resolution calls for:<ol>

<li>The creation of ". . .the Governors's commission for the review and formulation of building code implementation for areas that have not adopted a building code or are currently prohibited from adopting a building code. . . "</li>
<li>The Governor's commission to conduct a study and make recommendations by December 1, 1999, for any legislative action deemed necessary.</li>
<li>The dissolution of the commission by May 31, 2000.</li></ol></p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Local government code enforcement jurisdictions have 90 days to adopt the state building code once they receive notification from the state of change to the code.  If an approved local government code enforcement program does not exist, the State Building Codes Division enforces the applicable codes.  Three counties and 48 incorporated cities have adopted the state energy code.  The energy codes are reviewed on a three-year cycle corresponding to the adoption of new versions of the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Codes.  Proposed changes are submitted to the Building Codes Division.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The builder must provide a labeling sticker.  The label must be permanent and placed on the interior electrical panel.  The R-values and U-values provided for building envelope components and mechanical equipment efficiency must be shown on the label.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

When required by the building official, plans and specifications must be submitted.  The building official may also require that plans and specifications be prepared by a licensed architect or engineer.  A registered architect or engineer must prepare all Chapter 4 (MEC) submissions.  When the State Building Codes Division enforces the code, Section 105.2 of the MEC is not applicable.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Montana first adopted a statewide building code in 1972 with the adoption of the ICBO Uniform Codes.  Montana adopted the appendix of Chapter 53 (Energy) referenced in the 1985 Uniform Building Code, which referenced the 1983 MEC.

<p>The state adopted the 1993 MEC with minimal changes as the statewide energy code on February 9, 1996.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>On May 5, 1999, Governor Mike Johanns signed into law Legislative Bill 755, requiring that all state owned or state funded buildings comply with the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) effective January 1, 2000.</p>

<p>This state energy code applies to all new additions and modifications to existing buildings that exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the structure.  The state code does not apply to historical buildings and manufactured housing.  Manufactured housing units are regulated by the Nebraska Department of Health.</p>

<p>The energy office has also operated an incentive program to reduce the mortgage interest rate for homes built at or above 1995 MEC levels.  This program is currently being updated to a green building program which increases the minimum energy code requirement to the 2000 IECC.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

No set schedule exists for modifying the current building and/or energy codes.  The current energy code is referenced directly in legislation and can only be changed by the state legislature.

<p>Although the state code is mandatory statewide, local jurisdictions are not required to adopt or enforce it.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

In jurisdictions that have adopted a code, a plan review and inspection is required at the local level only if required by the local code authority.

<p>Plans for houses using incentive financing are reviewed and approved by the Nebraska Energy Office.</p>

<p>State agencies are responsible for code compliance in their new and remodeled buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Currently, the energy code is not actively enforced at the state level.  The city, county, or their designated enforcement agency may (but are not required to) adopt the MEC, or another code that is at least as stringent as the MEC, and provide the necessary enforcement at the local level.

<p>Required features in houses using incentive financing are inspected by lenders, with spot inspections by Nebraska Energy Office staff.</p>

<p>State agencies are responsible for verifying that their new and remodeled buildings comply with the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC).  The Nebraska Energy Office provides plan reviews technical assistance to support agencies and random inspections for compliance.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first energy code in Nebraska was adopted in 1980, based on the ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  This state code was modified in 1984 to require compliance with the 1983 MEC.  Legislation was proposed in the winter of 1994-1995 to adopt the 1992 MEC statewide.  The legislation did not pass and the code for general construction remains unchanged since 1984.   In 1999 the legislature passed a bill requiring compliance with the 1998 IECC for all new and remodeled state-owned buildings and new state-funded buildings.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The "Regulations for the Conservation of Energy in New Building Construction" are statewide minimum requirements for local jurisdictions that have not adopted a local energy code.  Such jurisdictions are required to enforce these regulations, but may adopt less-stringent regulations without state approval.</p>

<p>The state energy code is applicable to all newly constructed residential and nonresidential buildings and to new additions as outlined in the 1986 MEC, which includes all state-owned and -funded buildings, factory-built housing, and manufactured buildings whose construction is not regulated by the federal government (HUD.)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The authority of the Nevada State Energy Office to make changes to the energy code must be processed through the state legislature.  Many local jurisdictions have adopted more recent versions of the MEC.  All southern Nevada building departments have adopted the 1992 MEC, which includes Clark County, the city of Las Vegas, the city of North Las Vegas, the city of Henderson, Boulder City and the city of Mesquite.  In Northern Nevada, the city of Reno and the Lyons County building departments have adopted the 1995 MEC<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

The required envelope compliance pathways, plan submittal requirements, and requirements for engineer signatures are those contained in the 1986 MEC.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The city or county enforces the code except for state-owned and -funded buildings, which are regulated by the Nevada Public Works Board (NPWB).  The NPWB generally requires the plans to be stamped by a registered engineer or architect to indicate compliance with the energy code requirements.  Plans and specifications must be submitted when required by the provisions of the MEC.  Field inspections are performed by the local jurisdiction during established construction inspections.  Interpretations are the responsibility of the local jurisdiction<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Nevada's first energy code, "Energy Conservation Standards for New Building Construction," was adopted on January 1, 1978.  This code, based on ASHRAE Standard 90-75, was written by the state and formulated by the Nevada Department of Energy.  All cities and counties were required to enforce the energy code requirements.  The Nevada Department of Energy was disbanded in 1983.  Between 1983 and 1986, the state did not support or enforce this energy code.

<p>In 1985 the legislature gave the Nevada Office of Community Services authority to formulate new statewide standards for energy conservation in new buildings.  Adopted on July 8, 1988, the "Regulations for the Conservation of Energy in New Building Construction" were formulated based on the 1986 MEC with minor state amendments.  This code is applicable only in areas where the local jurisdiction had not previously adopted an energy code.  This remains the basis for the statewide energy code.  The Nevada Office of Community Services was dissolved in the fall of 1993.  Currently, the state does not actively support or enforce this energy code.</p>

<p>In 1995 the Nevada State Energy Office sought authority to upgrade the state energy codes via legislation submitted to the state legislature, but the Senate Finance Committee effectively killed the bill by failing to act on it.  The legislation would have adopted the 1992 MEC for all low-rise residential buildings and the codified version of the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES 90.1-1989 for all other buildings.  The state is pursuing voluntary compliance strategies.  The 1995 legislature imposed a two year moratorium on the adoption of new state regulations.</p>

<p>The Nevada State Energy Office is currently working to link the 1992, 1993, and 1995 editions of the MEC to a home energy rating system.  Nevada's EPAct certification, extended one year, reflects the Nevada legislature's inaction.</p><BR>

<p>House Bill 285 under consideration to adopt IECC 2000, including IECC 2000 statewide.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The statewide requirements are changed as needed; no definitive schedule is followed for updates.  Local governments may adopt different requirements only if those requirements are more stringent than the state code.  The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has the rulemaking authority to change the standards within the code.  The procedure consists of public meetings with all affected parties, reviews by the State Rules Committee, and public hearings by the New Hampshire PUC.  The entire process takes six months to a year to complete.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

All plans must be submitted to the local building code official.  If there is no code official, then the plans and a certificate of compliance application must be sent to the PUC for review and certification.

<p>MECcheck can be used to show compliance for residential buildings, and COMcheck for commercial buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The local building official enforces the energy requirements.  Compliance is shown by either 1) submitting a letter of certification for the building from a New Hampshire licensed architect or engineer to the town with a copy forwarded to the PUC or 2) processing an application for certificate of compliance through the PUC or the local building code official.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The original energy code for New Hampshire was enacted in response to PL-94-163.  This enabling legislation was RSA 155:D, which applied to both residential and commercial buildings and was based on ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-75 and the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards "Code for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction" dated December 1977.  RSA 155:C, which related to energy conservation in state-owned buildings, was later repealed.  The residential standards and administrative sections of RSA 155:D were revised in 1986.  The standards for commercial buildings were revised in 1993 to reflect the EPAct requirement for compliance with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.

<p>The original code was administered by the Governor's Council on Energy from 1979 to 1982.  When that state energy office closed in 1982, administrative responsibility was transferred to the New Hampshire PUC.  In 1990 the PUC was granted rulemaking authority over the code (i.e., ability to revise the code without an act of the legislature.)</p>

<p>The New Hampshire PUC held an informal work conference on a proposed rule to adopt the 1995 MEC on June 1, 1998.  At that time interested persons were given an opportunity to review the 1995 MEC requirments, learn how to comply with the 1995 MEC, review proposed PUC staff modifications to the 1995 MEC, and provide feedback to the PUC staff on the proposed rule.  The draft rule proposed several modifications to the MEC that would result in a less-stringent code.  In September 1998 the New Hampshire PUC adopted the 1995 MEC as the state's new residential building energy code.</p><BR>

<p>Local jurisdictions may not make amendments to the codes.</p>

<p>Several stakeholder groups are arranging to meet with NJ Dept. of Community Affairs to urge adoption of 95 MEC including basement insulation.  The first draft of a recently completed energy code needs assessment indicated strong support for the 95 MEC in NJ.  However, builders and state staff questioned the value of basement wall insulation.  The report's authors will provide additional analysis of basement wall insulation in the state.  (BCAP May/June 2000)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act provides that model codes and standards publications shall not be adopted more frequently than once every three years; however, a revision or amendment may be adopted at any time if the Commissioner of Community Affairs finds that an imminent peril exists to the public's health, safety, or welfare.   

<p>An announcement in the New Jersey Register is the legal mechanism that establishes the editions of the model codes and standards that have been adopted.  Amendments containing all necessary technical and editorial changes generally occur after this Register announcement.</><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined through the construction permit process that includes a plan review and site inspections.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

To enforce the requirements of the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act, the code officials must be licensed by the Licensing Section of the Bureau of Code Services, Division of Codes and Standards.  The construction code enforcement agency having jurisdiction enforces the uniform construction code requirements.  The Department of Community Affairs enforces the code for municipalities that have not established a construction code enforcement agency.

<p>In general, an owner applies to the construction code enforcement agency for a construction permit.  After completing a plan review the agency issues a release and performs inspections.  Therefore, compliance with the code is determined during the plan review and inspection process.  The following requirements are also in the regulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>All permit applications shall include not less than two copies of specifications and plans drawn to scale, with sufficient clarity and detailed dimensions to show the nature and character of the work to be performed.</li>
<li>The construction official and appropriate subcode officials shall periodically inspect the building during construction as necessary to ensure that all work conforms with the approved plans and the requirements of the regulations.</li></o><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The state of New Jersey passed the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act on October 7, 1975.  The Act became effective on February 3, 1976.  All construction codes and their enforcement were controlled by the provisions stated in the act.  Uniform Construction Code Regulations (NJAC 5:23-1 et seq.) went into effect on January 1, 1977.   

<p>The New Jersey Uniform Construction Code is divided into subcodes (model codes and standards) that are adopted individually by the Commissioner of Community Affairs.  The energy subcode contains the energy provisions.</p>

<p>The New Jersey Register dated July 6, 1998, indicates that the Division of Codes and Standards has adopted (as amended) the 1993 Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International National Energy Conservation Code (NECC) and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) Lighting Energy Management (LEM)-1 standard as its energy subcode.  Amendments modifying the energy subcode require commercial buildings (other than R-3, R-4, and R-2 less than or equal to three stories high as defined in the building subcode) to comply with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<p>Legislation enacted in June 1996 gives the Commissioner of Community Affairs authority to forego the adoption of model codes provisions that are inconsistent with the intent of the Uniform Construction Code Act.  The 1995 MEC, referenced in the 1996 BOCA International, National Codes, was not adopted because it was determined to be inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the New Jersey Uniform Construction Code Act.</><BR>

<p>Amendments to the 1992 MEC allow an amount equal to 1% if the conditioned floor area to be applied as skylights with no requirement to include them in the roof/ceiling U-value calculations.</p>

<p>The state energy code contains statewide mandatory minimum requirements that local jurisdictions must adopt and enforce.  Local jurisdictions must obtain approval from the State Construction Industries Commission to adopt more restrictive amendments.  All new residential and commercial buildings and additions to existing buildings that are heated and/or mechanically cooled are required to comply with the minimum code requirements.  Historical buildings are exempt.</p>

<p>The state will concentrate on trying to adopt the IECC 2000 this year or the next.  At the end of May, the state is planning to have an introductory meeting on this topic with the New Mexico Construction Industries Commission.  (BCAP May/June 2000).</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The state traditionally adopts the current version of the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Codes as a basis for all building codes.  These codes are adopted by the state on a three-year code cycle corresponding with the publication of the ICBO Uniform Codes.  Amendments, if any, to the current version of the MEC must first be proposed by a trade association or other construction group.  These amendments are then reviewed by a technical advisory committee composed of engineers and representatives of the building department and the state.  If approved by the committee, the changes are processed through a series of public hearings.  Once this cycle is complete, the final version of the amendments is prepared by Construction Industries Division staff and sent to the Construction Industries Commission.  If approved by the Commission, the changes are sent to Archives and become effective after a 30-day waiting period.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

All residential and commercial structures, as defined in the MEC, are required to comply with the New Mexico energy code.  Compliance and plan review requirements are those specified in the MEC.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Plan review and enforcement is regulated by the local jurisdiction (when they elect to enforce the code) as required in the MEC.  If the local jurisdiction does not elect to, or does not have personnel qualified to, enforce the code provisions, the Construction Industries Division provides the necessary reviews and inspections for residential buildings.  Technical assistance is provided to the Construction Industries Division by the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department for commercial buildings.  The Construction Industries Division reviews plans and inspects all state-owned or -funded buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The New Mexico Construction Industries Licensing Act of 1978 established requirements for all building trades contractors to be licensed and certified to ensure that compliance with the state codes is, to the maximum extent possible, uniform in application, procedure, and enforcement.  This Act has been updated periodically since 1978, most recently by amendments in December 1998.  New Mexico has adopted the ICBO Uniform Building Code for several years.  The most recent code adopted was the 1997 Uniform Building Code.<BR>

<P><B>Commercial Energy Code is mandatory statewide:</B><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The state energy code requires that all new commercial and residential buildings, manufactured housing not required to comply with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requirements, and buildings undergoing substantial rehabilitation must follow the code.  Historic buildings and buildings that do not use either electricity or fossil fuel for comfort conditioning are exempt from these requirements.</p>

<p>Requirements for commercial/residential buildings vary based on the location of the buildings within the state and the type of fuel used to heat the buildings.  For example, residential buildings that are electrically heated are required to have higher insulation values.  Residential buildings can also comply with a thermal rating method, which uses a point system to rate thermal efficiency levels.</p>

<p>The New York State Department of State (NY-DOS) is proceeding with rulemaking on a state energy code based on the 2000 IECC and 2001 supplement.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The NYS Department of State Codes Division has the responsibility to administer, make ammendments, and provide technical support in the form of interpretations and variances.  By legislative authority, the Secretary of State can, through regulation, amend the code.  Amendments are developed and adopted through a formal rulemaking process that includes a public review period.  Interested parties can provide written comments on the amendments prior to promulgating the changes.

<p>State legislation restricts the amendments to those that meet a 10-year discounted payback to the building owner.  Local governments may adopt their own energy conservation requirements after notifying the state but these requirements must be more restrictive than the current NYSECCC.  Currently no municipalities have adopted alternative requirements.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined through the normal building permit process that includes plan review and inspection by the government entity responsible for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the Building Construction Code or the Fire Prevention and Building Construction Code applicable within the municipality.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Enforcement of the state energy requirements is the responsibility of the governmental entity responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of the Building Construction Code or the Fire Prevention and Building Construction Code applicable within the municipality.   For areas without local municipal enforcement, the NYS Department of State must ensure that the minimum requirements of the code are met.  The local code official is responsible for reviewing all plans and specifications.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The New York state energy code became effective on January 1, 1979.  The state energy code was amended for residential buildings in 1989 and substantially rewritten in March 1991.  On July 29, 1999, the NYS Governer's Executive Chamber issued a press release announcing an agreement with the NYS legislature to allow for the state's conversion to a model energy code which will be suported by the recently awarded 1999 DOE State Energy Code Assistance Grant.  The implementation of a new energy code is anticipated to take affect January 2002.<BR>

<p>The NC Building Code Council has adopted the 2000 IECC with NC amendments effective December 31, 2001.  The amendments include adoption of ASHRAE 90.1-1999 effective December 31, 2001.  Chapter 11 of the 2000 IRC has also been adopted and includes NC amendments.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The North Carolina State Building Code Council is responsible for developing all state codes.  By statute, the Commissioner of Insurance has general supervision over the administration and enforcement of the North Carolina state building code.  Engineering Division staff serve on the Building Code Council.  Code changes are considered bi-annually and anyone may propose a code change.  Final authority to adopt criteria rests with the Building Code Council.  Public hearings are conducted bi-annually to consider revisions, with a June meeting ending the year.  Adopted code changes are then printed as replacement pages that can be incorporated into the code on a three-year cycle<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined by plan review and inspections through the normal building permit process.  Compliance forms are included in the energy provisions for both residential and commercial buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local units of government enforce the code through the permit/inspection process for new construction and additions.  The North Carolina Department of Insurance is responsible for general supervision of the effort statewide.  Depending on the size of the local government unit, the same individual may be responsible for performing plan reviews and inspections.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In December 1973 the North Carolina State Building Code Council adopted the Southern Building Code Congress (SBCC) Standard Building Code insulating standards as statewide requirements.  These standards were found to be too "prescriptive" and did not meet the particular requirements of North Carolina; therefore, an energy subcommittee was appointed to investigate energy conservation and study the ASHRAE standards that were being developed.  The committee recommended new energy requirements in March 1977, and the Building Code Council adopted these standards, which went into effect on January 1, 1978.

<p>In June 1991 an ad hoc energy committee was appointed by the Building Code Council to study and update the energy requirements in the state building code.  This committee began studying the state's current code as well as the 1989 MEC.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 shifted and refocused the committee's study efforts.  The committee completed its review of the 1992 MEC and the Building Code Council adopted the proposed new standards for one- and two-family dwellings, which became effective on April 15, 1993.</p>

<p>The 1994 SBCC Standard Building Code with North Carolina amendments was adopted by the Building Code Council and is known as the 1996 North Carolina Edition of the North Carolina State Building Code.  The energy requirements are contained in the new edition as Chapter 13.  Chapter 13 provides very simple prescriptive requirements for thermal envelope and references the new Volume X (Energy) for other systems.</p>

<p>In March 1995 the Building Code Council adopted Volume X (Energy) as the new energy code for North Carolina.  These new energy requirements became effective July 1, 1996.  Volume X is a reprint of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 (codified version) with North Carolina amendments.  The code applies to commercial buildings, including those used for assembly, business, education, and storage, as well as institutions and merchants.  High-rise and multi-family residential buildings are also covered under Volume X.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1996, the Building Code Council adopted the 1995 CABO One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code with North Carolina amendments effective July 1, 1997.  Chapter 39 contains a simplified prescriptive requirements for meeting the 1995 MEC based on MECcheck.</p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the state energy code must first be processed through the North Dakota Division of Community Services.  After a review by the Division of Community Services, changes are processed through a technical review committee composed of building officials, design professionals, and other applicable organizations and then through a series of public hearings.  Rules and regulations associated with a new code are established through the Administrative Practices Act.  Code changes are processed on a three-year code cycle corresponding to the publication of the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO)model codes.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance for state buildings is determined by plan review and inspection conducted by the agency constructing the building.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Statewide enforcement is not required by the state energy code.  State or local government-owned and -funded buildings are covered by the code, as well as buildings receiving federal grants from the OIA.  Enforcement is not required at the local level unless the code is adopted by a local jurisdiction.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

North Dakota's first energy code was adopted in 1977, which was based on ASHRAE/IES Standard 90-1975.  This code remained in effect until 1993 when the 1989 MEC was adopted as a statewide minimum/maximum standard for state-funded buildings and a voluntary standard for jurisdictions that chose to adopt an energy code.  In October 1995 the code was updated to the 1993 MEC.<BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the Ohio Basic Building Code are proposed by the Board of Building Standards.  The Board's powers and duties include adopting rules governing the construction, repair, and rehabilitation of buildings in the state; certifying municipal, township, and county building departments to administer the code; and establishing minimum standards for construction materials.  Thus, the Board is the primary state agency authorized to protect the public's safety and welfare in building design and construction.  The Division of State Fire Marshal, also in the Ohio Department of Commerce, promulgates the fire code.

<p>Rules proposed by the Board are filed with the Secretary of State, the Legislative Service Commission, and a committee of the General Assembly known as the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review (JCARR) at least 60 days prior to adoption.  The JCARR reviews the rules to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of the agency's statutory authority, do not conflict with another rule of the same or a different agency, and are consistent with the legislature's intent.  If acceptable, the rules go to public hearing at a time and place set by the agency in a public notice.  The public notice must be issued at least 30 days prior to the hearing and must include a synopsis of the proposed rules.  The hearing must be held within the 13th and 50th day after initial filing with the appropriate state agencies.  The agency may adopt the rules consistent with the synopsis 61 days after initial filing.  If, as a result of the public hearing, substantive changes are made that are inconsistent with the synopsis of the proposed rules, the rules must be refiled and a new hearing must be scheduled.  However, if substantive changes are made that are consistent with the synopsis, the rules must be refiled and then undergo a 30-day review before the board can adopt them.</p>

<p>Following adoption, the Board files the adopted rules with the appropriate state agencies.  The JCARR then has authority to review the adopted rules under the same criteria used with the rules as proposed.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined through plan review and inspection at the local level by the local building department.  If there is no certified building department within a jurisdiction, the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Industrial Compliance reviews and approves plans for commercial construction.  One-, two-, and three-family dwelling plans are not reviewed for MEC compliance at the state level.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Building officials whose building department has been certified by the Board of Building Standards enforce the provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code for their jurisdiction.  Plans must be submitted for all buildings within the scope of the code, as adopted by the state and local government.  The jurisdiction is required to review and approve the plans and to perform inspections to determine if the work performed conforms with the approved plans.  One-, two-, and three-family dwellings are reviewed by certified building departments only when they also have responsibility for one-, two-, and three-family dwelling plan review.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Prior to July 1, 1979, the rules of the Ohio Board of Building Standards were compiled in a document known as the Ohio Building Code.  On October 20, 1978, the Board adopted a rule, effective July 1, 1979, repealing most of the existing Ohio Building Code and adopting by reference, with special Ohio modifications, the Ohio Basic Building Code/1978, Seventh Edition (OBBC) and the Ohio Basic Mechanical Code/1978, Third Edition.  The Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International and Banks-Baldwin Law Publishing Company publish the Ohio codes.

<p>The resulting collection of model code sections and superseding Ohio provisions, together with the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC) and the Ohio Plumbing Code (which was retained from the former OBBC and is now based upon the 1995 International Plumbing Code) comprises the OBBC.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1995, Ohio adopted the 1993 MEC and the code version of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  These codes went into effect July 1, 1995.</p>

<p>Legislation (SB118 and MB 243) was proposed in 1996 to delete some provisions of the law.  It proposed to eliminate the Board of Building Standards directive for the adoption of new energy standards when technical advances would make the current standards obsolete or inadequate.  The act retained a provision to base the residential energy standards on HUD requirements (1993 MEC.)  It also eliminated the criminal penalty for builders that do not comply with the energy code.  The session recessed in June 1996 without acting on the bill.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1998, the 1995 MEC was adopted and became effective.</p>

<p>Problems associated with implementing the residential provisions of the MEC were addressed.  On June 27, 1997, a Budget Bill (HB 215) was signed and included a $300,000 study of the State Building Standards Law.  The Department of Commerce funded the study.  The MEC was reviewed within the context of this study.  The study defined how economics, enforcement, model code adoption, and the use of new materials impact safety, quality, and cost of construction.  Five public forums were held in June 1998 to hear comments about the OBBC.  Findings by the Department of Commerce were reported to the Governor and General Assembly in December 1998.</p><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Code changes must go through the state legislature, the governor, and be adopted by the Fire Marshal Commission.  Effective June 1, 1997, the State Fire Marshal's office has made the 1996 Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Building Code (NBC), which adopts the 1995 MEC by reference, mandatory for jurisdictions without codes and for all state-owned and -leased facilities.

<p>Each jurisdiction in the state has the authority to adopt one of the nationally recognized model codes, the codes the state uses, or codes that are comparable to the state codes.  These jurisdictions have full authority to adopt and amend any energy conservation requirements for buildings other than state-owned buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

For state-owned buildings, the Oklahoma Office of Central Services, Construction Properties Division, monitors the construction process for compliance with the relevant construction codes.  Non state-owned buildings must comply with whatever the state has put in place, which is currently the 1996 BOCA International NBC that includes the 1995 MEC.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local jurisdictions are responsible for enforcing any locally adopted codes.  The Oklahoma State Department of Central Services administers construction and maintenance programs for state-owned and -leased buildings.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The State Fire Marshal's Office made the BOCA International NBC, including the 1995 MEC, mandatory for jurisdictions without codes and for state facilities effective June 1, 1997.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Oregon One- and Two-Family Dwelling Specialty Code contains energy conservation requirements for one and 2 family dwelling construction.  The Oregon Structural Specialty Code, Chapter 13, contains energy conservation requirements for buildings, other than 1 and 2 family dwellings.</p>

<p>The state energy code provisions are mandatory for all heated and/or cooled residential and commercial construction, including state-owned and -operated buildings that are constructed, altered, and repaired within the state.  The energy conservation requirements are a mandatory statewide minimum that cannot be modified by local government without state approval.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the energy conservation requirements are submitted on code change forms to the Oregon Building Codes Division (BCD).  The Building Codes Structures Board (BCSB) reviews the proposed change to determine if the proposal warrants further consideration.  If accepted by the BCSB, the proposed changes are sent to the Energy Committee for review.  The Energy Committee is composed of members with varying expertise in the energy field.  After review by the Energy Committee the Committee submits its recommendations back to the BCSB in a public meeting.  The BCSB then makes a final recommendation based on all the inputs received from public, board members, and others in public hearings and work sessions of the board about the acceptance of the proposal.  The BCD administrator, under delegated authority from the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, makes a final determination about acceptance of the proposal.  

<p>Once the administrator accepts a proposal, rulemaking begins.</p>

<p>The Oregon Revised Statues (law) gives the BCD the authority to write rules that affect energy conservation in all regulated buildings.  The BCD, through the rulemaking process, writes rules to implement statutes.  These rules allow the BCD to adopt and amend model codes such as the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Code and the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code.  Anyone can submit code changes, which basically change rules, to the BCD at any time.  The Oregon Structural Specialty and One- and Two-Family Dwelling Codes are revised on a three-year cycle following the code change cycle of the relevant model code organization.  Emergency rules are incorporated into these state codes as necessary.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Plans and specifications showing all pertinent data in sufficient detail, including U- and R-values of materials, equipment sizes, and controls must be submitted to the enforcement agency (local or state.) 

<p>Compliance can be demontrated for residential construction either by using the prescriptive path or by completing a residential thermal performance calculation form for trade-offs of the exterior envelope requirements.</p>

<p>Documentation for commercial buildings must be submitted on standardized forms available from the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) or the BCD.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Plans and specifications must be submitted unless exempted by the building official.  If required by the building official, the plans must be stamped by registered design professionals.  The codes establish minimum submittal requirements concerning R-values, equipment efficiencies, and lighting components.  Field inspections are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

<p>For all buildings, the city, county, or designated enforcement agency may either enforce the code or have the BCD enforce the code.  Currently, the BCD has four district offices throughout the state that enforce the code for approximately 75% of the state's land area, but only about 10% of the population base.  The BCD also provides plan review and inspections for all prefabricated structures located within the state and inspections of all manufactured housing.  Interpretations are issued by the local jurisdiction enforcing the code.  A jurisdiction can request an advisory ruling from the BCD.  A request for an interpretive ruling can be made to the BCD, approved or disapproved by BCSB, then approved or disapproved by the BCD administrator.  An interpretive ruling is mandatory throughout the state.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Oregon's first energy conservation requirements were developed in 1975 and were limited to residential buildings.  This code was upgraded in 1978 and again in 1980 to reflect the new editions of the ASHRAE standards (90-75, 90A-80, 90B-75.)  Since 1980, the residential energy conservation requirements have been amended on a three-year cycle in sequence with the Oregon One- and Two- Family Dwelling Specialty Code.  Previous energy conservation requirements were put into effect January 1, 1993.  New energy conservation requirements for residential buildings became effective April 1, 1996.

<p>The energy conservation requirements for commercial buildings were developed in 1978 and upgraded in 1980.  Since 1980, the energy conservation requirements have been upgraded in sequence with the Oregon Structural Specialty Code.  Previous energy conservation requirements became effective on April 1, 1996.  New energy conservation requirements for commercial buildings were adopted and became effective on October 1, 1998.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The governor signed into law the new mandatory statewide Uniform Construction Code on November 10, 1999.  The new code adopts the 1999 BOCA codes including the 1998 IECC and mandates code upgrades whenever a new BOCA code edition is published.  The Department of Labor and Industry is currently developing rulemaking to adopt the 2000 IECC as the most modern code update available.  They hope to implement the code by spring of 2001.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry (DLI) and the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED] have the authority to promulgate and upgrade commercial and residential energy standards, respectively, when appropriate, through the regulatory process.  The modification process involves public meetings and hearings prior to finalization.  The code is not updated on a regular schedule.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined by builder or designer certification to DCED or DLI.  For residential construction, the DCED has the authority to conduct energy inspections of residential properties.  The homeowner may use the inspection report to require the builder to achieve compliance.  For nonresidential construction, an architect or engineer must sign a compliance statement stating that the building complies with the energy code.  No follow-up energy inspections are conducted.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Building Energy Conservation Act divides the responsibility for administering Act 222 between the DCED for residential construction and the DLI for commercial construction.

<p>Local governments can enforce the residential regulations if they choose.  Currently, 144 of 2,600 local governments elect to enforce the Building Energy Conservation Act requirements.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The Pennsylvania legislature passed the Building Energy Conservation Act (BECA: Act 222) in 1980 to regulate the energy-related aspects of new construction, additions, and major renovations.  In 1986 the Act was legislatively updated with regard to requirements for residential buildings (one- and two-family dwelling units, row houses, townhouses, and garden apartment construction, not exceeding three stories in height with individual and self-supporting HVAC systems).  The residential standards have been revised three times since the Building Energy Conservation Act was enacted, the last time in 1986.  The commercial standards were updated once in 1983.  The Pennsylvania Energy Office, which was given certain support responsibilities in Act 222, was dissolved as of June 30, 1995.

<p>State legislation that was being considered in committee would adopt the 1993 Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Building Code as the statewide building code with the energy provisions being those given in Act 222.  A revised building code bill was presented to the house local government committee in May 1996.  The bill calls for the adoption of the 1996 BOCA International, National Codes, including the 1995 MEC referenced therein, and the repeal of Act 222.  The legislation (HB 1128) passed the house and is being considered by the senate in Fall 1996.  As written, the bill does not mandate that all local governments adopt the statewide building code.  In those jurisdictions that choose not to adopt the statewide building code, and in the absence of the mandatory requirements of Act 222, there would be no energy requirements.</p><BR>

<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The Rhode Island Building Code Commission began forming in 1974.  By 1977 the state of Rhode Island had adopted a statewide building code.  Later, energy provisions were made part of the state building code modeled after the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Energy Conservation Code.  In 1988 the state of Rhode Island amended the energy conservation requirements in the 1987 BOCA National Building Code (NBC) to modify the thermal requirements for residential and commercial buildings.  In January 1992 the 1990 BOCA NBC was adopted as the Rhode Island state building code, also with state amendments.

<p>The state building code is currently based on the 1996 BOCA NBC and the 1996 National Mechanical Code, both with May 1, 1997, state amendments.  Chapter 13 of the 1997 state building code referencing the 1995 MEC, which also has May 1, 1997 amendments, became effective May 1, 1997.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1998, additional amendments to the state building code were adopted, including some minor revisions to the 1995 MEC and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  These amendments mathematically changed U-values to R-values with no revision to technical stringency.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The South Carolina Energy Code is part of the State Building Code as outlined in Title 6, Chapter 9, of the SC Code of Laws.  This mandates a statewide building code and energy code.  Section 6-9-50, states that a residential building is considered in compliance with the Building Envelope Requirements of the Model Energy Code, if (1) it is built in compliance with prescriptive standards issued by the South Carolina Residential Builders Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Office, based on computer models of the Model Energy Code including, but not limited to, options developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratories for South Carolina's climatic zones, or, (2) if double pane or single pane with storm windows are used for window glass and in the case of ceilings, exterior walls, floors with crawl space, and heating and air conditioning duct work, the determination of the minimum thermal resistance ratings (R-value) is: (a) R-30 for ceilings, except for ceiling/roof combinations, which must be at least R-19; (b) R-13 for exterior walls; (c) R-19 for floors with crawl space; (d) R-6, or the installed equivalent, for heating and air conditioning duct work not located in conditioned space.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Adoption of changes is achieved by state legislation.  Over 60% of the state's municipalities and counties have adopted the state building code.  By the year 2001 the state of South Carolina will have an enforced building code in place.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

In areas where local governments have adopted the code, compliance is determined by plan review and inspection by local building officials.  For local government with no building official, the engineer or director of public works or chief fire inspector may be called upon to act as the enforcement agency.  Some jurisdictions may accept a registered design professional's seal on a letter stating that the design conforms with the adopted code.  Acceptance of such a letter is totally up to the local building official.  Disputes between owners, builders, or design professionals and the local building official can be taken to the local Board of Appeals (BOA) for a hearing.  Decisions made by the BOA are ethically binding on the participating parties.  Details of this process are provided in Chapter 1 of the Standard Building Code.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local units of government enforce the code through the normal inspection process.  Depending on the size of the local government unit, the same individual may be responsible for performing plan reviews and inspections.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The South Carolina Building Energy Efficiency Standard Act was first enacted in 1979.  The Act referenced the Southern Building Code Congress, International (SBCCI) Standard Building Code for energy provisions.  Over time, revisions were undertaken by the legislature.

<p>The 1993 Building Energy Efficiency Standard Act, enacted by SB 1273, adopts Appendix E (at the time of passage) of the current version of the SBCCI Standard Building Code.  The 1994 edition of the Standard Building Code requires compliance with the 1993 Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC), although ANSI/ASHRAE/IES 90A or 90B is adopted in the Standard Building Code as an option for one- and two-family dwellings and multi-family residential buildings not over three stories high.  Alternative compliance criteria using a list of thermal envelope requirements is also provided for one- and two-family dwellings.  ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-1989, which is adopted by reference in the adopted 1993 MEC, is applicable to commercial buildings and residential buildings over three stories high.</p>

<p>A bill (S.66), filed in 1994 to require all municipalities and counties to adopt the most current building codes, passed the South Carolina State Senate in February 1996 and was sent to the Real Estate Subcommittee of the House Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee, where it was rejected.  The bill called for the adoption and enforcement of the latest editions of the SBCCI Standard Codes and the MEC.  Opposition was based on the need for local governments to raise taxes or fees to implement the codes.  The state hoped to reintroduce the same bill after the November 1996 elections.</p>

<p>On February 18, 1997, HB 3175, requiring statewide use of the most up-to-date building codes, which would require adoption and enforcement of the 1995 MEC, passed the South Carolina House Committee on Labor, Commerce and Industry.  A similar bill, Senate Bill 236, passed the Senate on February 19 and was referred to the House Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee.  The bill requires that all municipalities and counties adopt and enforce the latest editions of the SBCCI Standard Codes and the MEC.  The Governor signed a statewide building code bill in the summer of 1997.</p><BR>

These proposals must first be processed through the state legislature.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the state building code must first be processed through the state legislature.  Changes are processed on a three-year code cycle corresponding with the publication of the Uniform Codes.  Local jurisdictions may adopt energy requirements without state approval.  Only larger jurisdictions have elected to do so at this time.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance with local codes is decided by local jurisdictions.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

An energy code is not enforced at the state level.  If a local energy code is adopted, it is enforced at the local level.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

In 1978 when the South Dakota building code was first enacted, an energy code was part of Chapter 53 of the state building code.  However, only three jurisdictions adopted the energy code portion of the state building code.  As of 1994, no jurisdictions actively enforced the energy code portion of the state building code.<BR>

<p>The IECC 2000 adopted statewide, effective 9/1/2001.  2000 International Residential Code (IRC) adopted statewide, effective Jan. 1, 2002.
</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

For buildings other than state-owned buildings, energy codes must be adopted by local code jurisdictions to be enforceable.  Such adoption is normally achieved through a vote of the city council or the local government adoption process.  Depending on the form of government, the mayor may be required to sign the law.  Most local jurisdictions adopt either the Standard or Uniform Building Codes as their building code, but a few adopt the National Building Codes (NBC).  The energy codes or standards are usually adopted by reference in the applicable building code (e.g., the MEC is adopted by reference in the NBC and in an Appendix of the SBC and UBC.)

<p>For state-owned or -funded buildings, the provisions are adopted through the state's administrative process of publication, public comment, and hearings.</><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

For state-owned or -funded buildings, the design professional submits a completed compliance statement and certification to the cognizant state agency that the design is in compliance with the Texas Design Standard or the MEC (as applicable based on the building type.)

<p>For all other buildings in jurisdictions that have adopted energy provisions, compliance is determined through the permit process.  Typically, plans are submitted and reviewed and then buildings are inspected.  After successful completion of this process, the building department issues a certificate of occupancy.</><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

For state-owned or -funded buildings, the cognizant state agency enforces the code.

<p>For all other buildings, the cognizant local government enforces the code.  If a jurisdiction adopts an energy code, the code is enforced through the permit/inspection process for new construction and additions.  Depending on the size of the jurisdiction, the same individual may perform plan reviews and inspections.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Except for state-owned buildings, Texas has no mandatory statewide energy code for either residential or commercial buildings.  Texas is a home rule state; thus, state law cannot override local law.  No attempts have been made to adopt mandatory energy codes on a statewide basis.  The state is encouraging voluntary adoption and use by training code officials and home builders.

<p>For state-owned commercial buildings and multi-family residential buildings over three stories in height, Texas has adapted ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-1989 into the Texas Design Standard.  This standard, which originally went into effect in June 1989, was updated in February 1993.   For state-owned residential buildings, Texas has adopted the 1993 CABO MEC.</><BR>

<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The draft Virgin Islands Energy Building Code has to be adopted through the legislative process.<BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

After the code is adopted, applicants requiring building permits for new structures will first submit a completed Energy Conservation Code Guideline Form to the Virgin Islands Energy Office for approval before the Department of Planning and Natural Resources can issue a permit.

<p>All construction or work (including plans and other required documents) for which a permit is required are subject to inspection by the Virgin Islands government building or energy inspector.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Final inspection and approval of all buildings ready for occupancy is to be completed by the Virgin Islands government building or energy inspector within 10 working days of a formal request.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The Virgin Islands building code was first enacted on April 1, 1964, but did not address energy conservation in new building construction and/or major renovations.  The building code was adopted pursuant to Chapter 5, Title 29, of the Virgin Island Code.  It adopted by reference the ICBO 1994 Uniform Building Code and subsequent amendments for buildings except one- and two-family dwellings.  Chapter 13 on energy conservation was not adopted.  For one- and two-family dwellings, the one- and two-family dwelling code and subsequent amendments were adopted.  Appendix E on energy conservation was not adopted.

<p>In 1990 the Virgin Islands Energy Office (VIEO) initiated a review of the Draft Virgin Islands Code for Energy Conservation in New Building Construction.  This proposed code partially adopted ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for commercial construction and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.2 for residential construction and eliminated the heating requirements within those documents.  That draft code was never adopted as part of the building code.</p>

<p>In 1995 the Virgin Islands Energy Office requested technical and financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Energy to review the draft energy code.  A technical team reviewed the draft code and determined that it was lengthy, confusing, and not user-friendly.  The team then composed a more user-friendly residential and commercial code based on the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC) and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.  The current draft, the Virgin Island Energy Building Code, addresses ventilation, shading, and cooling in residential homes.  The commercial provisions address cooling, lighting, insulation, and water heating.  This draft has not been finalized and adopted.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The 1995 Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC) was amended in Section 502.2.1 by referring to different requirements for metal stud framing.  Specifically, the Uw (thermal transmittance for an opaque wall [w]) for a metal stud wall must be as published in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, using an approved ASHRAE series or parallel approach calculation, or U-values shown in the "Users Manual for ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989."</p>

<p>The codified version of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-1989 was amended to allow building officials to approve designs which do not conform where in his/her opinion full compliance is physically and/or economically impractical.</><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the energy code are submitted to the Uniform Building Code Commission.  The proposed change is reviewed by the Commission at a monthly meeting to decide if it warrants further consideration.  If accepted, the Commission determines if enforcement will be enacted as a statewide amendment or restricted to a specific locality.

<p>Currently, changes can be submitted to the Commission at any time.  Changes are published on March 1 and September 1 of each year.  Approved changes are incorporated into the code on a three-year cycle corresponding to the International Conference for Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Code cycle.  Enforcement by the local enforcement agency is mandatory once changes are approved.</><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

All residential buildings (one- and two-family dwellings, and multi-family dwellings three stories high and less) comply with the 1995 MEC using the compliance pathways, plan submittal, and plan review as specified within that code.  Commercial and high-rise residential buildings that must comply with ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1999 follow the compliance pathways in that code and go through a similar plan submittal and plan review process.

<p>Plans and specifications must be submitted when required by the local jurisdiction.  Field inspections, as part of the normal building inspection process, are required prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.</p>

<p>If the local compliance agency refuses to establish a method of appeal to their interpretation and application of the State Uniform Building Standards, the appealing party may petition the Building Code Commission for agency action on the issue.</><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The energy code is part of the enforcement process for the state building code, which is mandatory statewide.  However, actual enforcement of the energy code provisions by the local enforcement agency is sporadic.  Educational programs that began in September/October 1994 are expected to improve the actual compliance with the energy code requirements.

<p>The Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing is responsible for enforcement for all state-owned or -funded buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

A Utah Uniform Building Standards Act was passed in 1953.  In January 1976 a bill was passed that provided for the adoption of an energy conservation code for state buildings, suggested voluntary compliance by the state's political subdivisions, and recommended voluntary compliance by the state's building industry.  In March 1977 legislation was passed requiring the Building Board to promulgate an energy conservation code and providing political subdivisions and the State Board of Education authority to adopt their own code or a modified version of the state code.  Effective January 1978, a code based on the Model Code for Energy Conservation (MCEC) went into effect.

<p>In July 1993 the Uniform Building Standards Act was amended to provide that the Division of Professional Licensing, along with the Building Code Commission, adopt by rule the specific edition of the National Electrical Code (NEC), Uniform Building Code (UBC), Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC), and Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) to be used as the state standard.  Power was also given to adopt successor editions of the adopted codes.</p>

<p>On February 14, 1995, amendments adopted Appendix Chapter 13 of the 1994 UBC with a sole reference to the 1993 MEC for low-rise residential buildings and a sole reference to ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 for high-rise residential and commercial buildings.</p>

<p>Amendments to Appendix Chapter 13, Section 1302.2, of the UBC were adopted effective July 1, 1998, indicating low-rise residential buildings shall be designed to comply with the requirements of the 1995 MEC.  Commercial and high-rise residential buildings shall be designed to comply with the requirements of the Energy Code for Commercial and High-Rise Residential Building, which is a codification of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989, Energy Efficient Design of New Buildings except Low-Rise Residential Buildings.</><BR>

The first revision to the 1997 RBES will occur in 1999 and subsequent revisions will be developed and adopted every three years thereafter.  The 1999 revision will include ventilation standards and may include sealed-combustion and outside air requirements for wood and pellet stoves and fireplaces.  Construction commencing after the effective date of an RBES revision must meet the revised RBES standard.  Act 250 issues are addressed by the District Environmental Commissions or the appellate Environmental Board.  The Burlington City Council oversees the Burlington city ordinance.

<p>The Vermont Department of Public Service must provide technical assistance and expert advice to the Commissioner of Labor and Industry on the interpretation of the RBES and in formulating specific revisions to the RBES.  At least one year prior to adopting required revisions to the RBES, the Department of Public Service must convene an advisory committee to provide recommendations to the commissioner.</p>

<p>Amendments to the RBES must be cost-effective and affordable for consumers and evaluated based on technical applicability and reliability.  The effective date of any revisions must be at least three months after adoption.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Act 250 compliance is determined by nine quasi-judicial District Environmental Commissions.  The Vermont Department of Labor and Industry determines compliance for state-funded new commercial construction.  The city of Burlington Department of Public Works determines compliance with the Burlington city ordinance.  Burlington has adopted the RBES for new residential buildings and additions over 500 square feet.

<p>Compliance with the RBES is through self-certification by the builder on a one-page form.  Five different ways to comply with the RBES are available after the list of basic requirements has been satisfied--1) a prescriptive list of features, 2) tradeoff variations, 3) VTcheck software, 4) a home energy rating greater than or equal to 82, or 5) an A/E systems analysis.</p>

<p>A homeowner can seek damages within six years of occupancy if a home fails to meet the RBES.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The Vermont Twenty Year Electric Plan (December 1994) states that while Act 250 has undoubtedly saved energy, the energy requirements are not effectively enforced.  The standard for state-funded new commercial construction projects is also not effectively enforced.  The Vermont Department of Public Service and several utilities have instituted an inspection process for Act 250 commercial projects.  The city of Burlington Department of Public Works enforces the Burlington city ordinance.

<p>The RBES requires that a certification label be signed and permanently affixed in the home.  The person certifying compliance must provide a certificate to the Vermont Department of Public Service and each certificate must be recorded and indexed in the town land records.  The builder of the home, a licensed architect or engineer, or a Vermont-accredited home energy rating organization can certify compliance with the RBES.  The RBES does not require inspections by code officials; however, it does not eliminate inspections related to Act 250, spot checks for enforcement of other codes, or inspections required by local codes.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Act 250 was first adopted in 1970 with the energy criteria added in 1973.  Act 250 required that certain developments incorporate energy conservation measures that employed the best available technology based on life-cycle cost analysis.  The Vermont Department of Public Service reviewed and provided comments on Act 250 applications to nine District Environmental Commissions that issue land use permits.  

<p>In 2000, the city of Burlington updated its Energy Effiiciency Guidelines for all new residential and commercial construction based on RBES and IECC 2000/ASHRAE 90.1-1999 with Vermont amendments.</p>

<p>Effective June 30, 1993, all state-funded new commercial construction and additions are required to meet the State Buildings Energy Conservation Standard, which is a modified version of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<p>Effective July 1, 1997, RBES (21 V.S.A 266) applies to residential construction subject to Act 250.  As of July 1998 it applies to all residential construction in the state.  The 1997 RBES adopted the 1995 MEC, including amendments.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (VUSBC) is a statewide minimum requirement that local jurisdictions cannot amend.  The code is applicable to all new buildings in the commonwealth.  The VUSBC requires that any new construction (addition) to existing buildings comply with the requirements of the 1995 MEC; unaltered portions of the building are not required to comply.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Virginia adopts the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) International, National Building Code a year after the publication year by BOCA (which occurs every three years.)  The Board of Housing and Community Development (a Governor-appointed board) has authority to adopt changes to the VUSBC.  The process is very similar to the federal regulatory process.  The Board of Housing and Community Development may adopt whatever provision it deems necessary.  The adoption process for modifications may take 12 months.  Publications include new provisions and modifications to the code.  Public hearings are also included in the process.

<p>The General Assembly also promulgates requirements for the VUSBC.  These requirements ONLY apply to state buildings.  The scope of these provisions are items such as asbestos removal and minimum temperature settings that are not addressed in the VUSBC.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance for non state buildings is demonstrated through plan review and inspection at the local level.

<p>The Director of the Virginia Department of General Services, acting through the Division of Engineering and Buildings, acts as the code official for state buildings.  This office performs plan reviews and construction inspections for all state buildings.</p><BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

The local building department enforces the VUSBC requirements through plan reviews and inspections.  An appeal to the code official's decision is also handled at the local level.  The Virginia Statewide Building Code Technical Review Board is responsible for official interpretations of the VUSBC.  The board meets to review a request for interpretation upon receipt.  Other interested and affected parties have an opportunity to participate in the interpretation.  It generally takes 90 days for an interpretation to be approved.  Official interpretations are published in the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development monthly newsletter and serve to clarify certain provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code.  An official interpretation is considered law and must be enforced by the applicable state and local agencies<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Virginia adopted the VUSBC in 1973, a statewide building code based on the BOCA Basic Codes.  The statewide requirements cannot be modified by local jurisdictions.  Prior to 1973, local government was free to adopt codes.  The current statewide building code adopts the 1995 MEC by reference for energy efficiency criteria, effective April 15, 1997.<BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The Washington State Energy Office was terminated on July 1, 1996, and its functions were assumed by other agencies.</p>

<p>The state is currently in the process of reviewing its energy code.  There were nearly 100 changes to the Washington State Energy Code proposed.  The Washington State Building Code Council has referred these proposals to the Energy Code Technical Advisory Group for review.  By mid-June the analysis of the amendments should be returned to the State Building Code Council, which will debate and vote on amendments through October. (BCAP May/June 2000)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

Changes to the state energy code are submitted to the State Building Code Council (SBCC) on standardized forms.  Within 60 days of receipt of a proposed change, the SBCC decides if the proposal warrants further consideration.  If the SBCC accepts the change, rulemaking begins and the change is sent to a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for review.  The TAG members have varying expertise in the construction industry related to the proposed change.  After completing the review, the TAG submits its recommendations back to the SBCC.  The SBCC then makes the final determination on acceptance.  Legislative oversight is provided because the SBCC has two senators and two representatives as ex-officio nonvoting council members.

<p>Changes are instituted on a three-year cycle corresponding with the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Code cycle.  Once final approval is granted by the SBCC, the rule is filed with the Washington State Code Reviser and then published in the Washington State Register.  The final rule becomes effective after the next legislative session.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined by plan review and inspection by the local building official.  Plans and specifications must be submitted unless otherwise required by the building official.  The building official may also require that the plans be stamped by a registered design professional for more complicated designs.  The energy code for residential buildings establishes minimum/maximum requirements for R-values and equipment efficiencies.  Field inspections are required before a certificate of occupancy is issued.  The energy code for commercial buildings sets minimum inspection requirements for the building envelope, mechanical systems, and lighting installations.  The building official has the power to interpret both the residential and commercial energy codes.  The building official may also request the SBCC to render written interpretations of both the residential and commercial energy codes<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

For commercial buildings, the city or county, or its designated enforcement agency, can enforce the code or require the building owner to hire a certified nonresidential energy special inspector to perform the plan review and/or field inspection.  The energy plan reviewers and special inspectors are certified through a program regulated by the Washington Association of Building Officials (WABO.)  Certification requires that individuals complete a comprehensive testing program and have specific credentials.  Re-certification is required when changes are made to the code.  Technical assistance is offered through the Northwest Energy Efficiency Council (NEEC.)

<p>For residential buildings, the city or county, or its designated enforcement agency, regulate enforcement.  Technical assistance is offered through the Washington State University (WSU) Cooperative Extension Energy Program.  WSU is also a technical advisor to the SBCC for energy-related items and assists the TAG.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

Washington's first energy code, adopted in 1977 by statute, was a voluntary requirement.  The State Building Code Act and State Energy Code Act (SECA) were passed by the legislature in 1985.  The State Building Code Act gave rulemaking authority to the SBCC, which oversees all building and energy codes within the state. 

<p>The first statewide energy code, adopted in 1986, was applicable to all new buildings, and was based on ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90A-1980.</p>

<p>In 1990 the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) was amended by HB 2198.  HB 2198 amended RCW 19.27A (Energy-Related Building Standards) and increased the insulation requirements for residential buildings based on the energy source cost.  Different insulation requirements were established based on climate zone and fuel type.  The State Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Code was also established at that time.</p>

<p>In 1991 another amendment to RCW 19.27A resulted in a modification to the commercial energy standards that were contained in the 1986 energy code.  The modifications included more restrictive exterior envelope insulation requirements, increased equipment efficiencies, more restrictive controls on HVAC equipment, minimum motor efficiencies, and reduced allowable lighting power allowances.  The updated code is based on the ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 and became effective April 1, 1994.</p>

<p>The entire energy code is contained in the state of Washington Administrative Code (WAC), (Chapter 51-11 Washington Administrative Code).  Chapters 1-10 "Residential Energy Code", contain the requirements for R-occupancy buildings (1994 Uniform Building Code), which include single-family dwellings, apartments, and residential portions of hotels and motels.  Chapters 11-20, "Nonresidential Energy Code", contain the requirements for all other building occupancies.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>Energy code training based on the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is planned for October 1999.  The State Fire Marshall's Office has indicated that the energy standards will be reviewed when the next Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) codes are available in 2000.</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The West Virginia State Fire Commission is responsible for adopting and promulgating statewide construction codes.  The Administrative Procedures Act requires public hearings on the adoption of all codes by the State Fire Commission. The State Fire Commission promulgates the State Fire Code and the State Building Code.  The State Fire Commission has authority to modify these codes. 

<p>When the State Fire Commission proposes to adopt a code or requirement pertaining to a specific problem under its jurisdiction, the code is filed with the Secretary of State.  The commission conducts a public hearing and can modify the rule with the Secretary of State as an agency-approved rule.  The rule is then filed with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee.  Once the rule is approved or modified by the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee, it is introduced as a separate bill during the legislative session.  As a proposed bill, the legislature must pass the rule and the Governor must sign it into law.  Legislation need not be initiated by the State Fire Commission; the legislature can modify the code by proposing legislation at any time during the regular session.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Local jurisdictions must adopt the statewide requirements to enforce them at the local level.  For jurisdictions that adopt the statewide codes, compliance is determined by plan review and inspection by local building officials.  If local jurisdictions do not adopt the statewide codes, contractors, builders, and architects are responsible for complying with the provisions of the codes.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

Local jurisdictions that have adopted the state building code are the enforcing authority.  The local code official reviews the plans and completes a building inspection.  For local jurisdictions that have not adopted the energy code, the State Fire Marshal is responsible for enforcement.<BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The West Virginia legislature passed laws dealing with energy conservation in response to the energy crisis.  The state requirements consist of three separate laws.   In 1977 legislators passed the West Virginia Energy Conservation Revolving Loan Fund and in 1980 passed the Energy Cost Reduction Guidelines.

<p>A state building code was authorized by the legislature in 1988 and became effective April 28, 1989, preempting all other local codes.  The State Fire Marshal had requested this legislation in 1987.  The State Fire Commission appointed 11 members, approved the Fire Marshal's request, and worked with the legislature to successfully pass legislation authorizing the State Fire Commission to promulgate a state building code.</p>

<p>Effective April 3, 1991, the 1990 National Energy Conservation Code (NECC) was adopted by reference (Title 87, Series 4, Section 4.1, Legislative Rules) along with other codes for building design and construction.  A state fire code also exists, which adopts various National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Standards and takes precedence when a conflict arises with the building code.</p>

<p>Legislation was introduced in the 1996 legislative session that would have adopted the 1993 National Building Code (NBC.)  Chapter 13 of the NBC addresses energy conservation in building design and construction.  Through a clerical oversight, the legislature did not include the 1993 NBC in final legislation.  The State Fire Marshal requested an emergency rule from the Secretary of State that would enact the 1993 NBC.  The request was approved.  The legislature passed a law formally adopting the 1993 NBC on April 6, 1997.</p><BR>

<P><B>Current Status Notes:</B><BR>
<p>The codes apply to all new construction, including building alternations and additions, except Department of Commerce (COMM) Chapter 67 requirements, which apply only to rental properties over 10 years old.</p>

<p>Currently, the provisions in ILHR 22 for one- and two-family dwellings include a prescriptive list of requirements for the thermal envelope.  The requirements differ depending on whether the home is electrically heated.  A whole-house performance option is also included.</p>

<p>COMM Chapter 67 requirements (for existing residential rental properties) may require up to R-11 insulation in side walls, R-38 insulation in attics, and R-19 in floors over vented spaces.  These values are dependent on the heating degree-days of the area.</p>

<p>Currently, the state writes, and implements its own commercial building code for use across the entire state.  However, the International Code family, including the 2000 International Mechanical Code (IMC) and 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), are currently being reviewed for adoption in place of the current Wisconsin Commercial Building Code.  The final version will include Wisconsin amendments.  Drafts of the IMC & IECC codes and proposed amendments are expected to be available for public review in early June.  Public hearings are expected to be held in late summer/early fall.  (BCAP May/June 2000)</p><BR>


<P><B>Adoption Process:</B><BR>

The state energy codes are reviewed for possible updates every three to five years.  The code is adopted by the Department of Commerce after a code development and public hearing process.  A description of the process within the Department of Commerce follows.

<p>The state code provisions are developed within the Office of Codes and Applications, which is part of the Safety and Buildings Division of the Department of Commerce.  Any modifications to the code (suggested by builders, property owners, material suppliers, architects, engineers, staff, or other state agencies, or required by legislative mandate) are developed in accordance with Chapter 227 of the Wisconsin Statutes.</p>

<p>The Division of Safety and Buildings drafts proposed administrative rules, which are reviewed by an outside committee of industry representatives.  The code language is then presented to the Secretary of Commerce for approval.  Once approved, the proposals are reviewed at public hearings to gather comments.  Following any changes after the public hearings, the code is transferred to the two standing legislative committees for approval.  If approved, the department may adopt the rules and then determine an effective date, based on printing, distribution, and other schedules.</p>

<p>COMM Chapters 63 and 67 requirements may be changed by local governments or agencies by ordinance only if the alternative requirments are as restrictive as those in the referenced code.  COMM Chapter 22 requirements must be applied without local modification.</p><BR>


<P><B>Compliance Method:</B><BR>

Compliance is determined through plan review and inspection by local or state building officials for COMM Chapters 22 and 63 requirements.  For COMM Chapter 67 requirements, the Department licenses 750 private individuals, under COMM 5, who conduct energy audits when residential rental properties are sold.  The energy audits for compliance are commissioned by the owner of the property within one year of transfer.  The owner and the Department are given a copy of the compliance certificate.<BR>


<P><B>Enforcement:</B><BR>

After plan review by the state or a certified municipality, COMM Chapter 63 requirements are enforced in the field by local municipal building inspectors for communities that have local inspections.  In communities without a local inspector, the state Department of Commerce's inspectors are responsible.  

<p>COMM Chapter 22 requirements are enforced by the local municipal building inspector after the municipality adopts the code.  If a jurisdiction chooses not to adopt and enforce the code,  the Department of Commerce administers and enforces the code.  Enforcement is mandatory for municipalities with populations over 2,500.</p>

<p>COMM Chapter 67 inspections are conducted by private-sector inspectors who are licensed by the Department of Commerce under COMM Chapter 5 requirements.  All enforcement is done by Department of Commerce certified inspectors and plan examiners.</p><BR>


<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The first state building code in Wisconsin was established in 1914.   All of the referenced codes listed below were adopted in the mid to late 1970s.  The state was looking for ways to reduce its dependence on foreign (other states and countries) energy sources.  The state was also attempting to reduce the need for future power plant construction by reducing or controlling the amount of electricity used for heating.

<p>The Division of Safety and Buildings was previously associated with the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations (ILHR.)  As of July 1, 1996, the division was relocated to the Department of Commerce (COMM.)</p>

<p>Department of Commerce (COMM) Chapter 63, which regulates energy conservation in multi-family residential (other than one- and two-family dwellings) and other commercial buildings, was created in May 1978 and became effective July 1, 1978.  COMM Chapter 22, which regulates energy conservation measures in one- and two-family dwellings, was created in May 1978 and became effective December 1, 1978.  COMM Chapter 67, which regulates energy conservation measures in existing residential rental properties, was created February 1, 1983, and became effective January 1, 1985.</p>

<p>Among numerous other criteria applicable to building design and construction, the state of Wisconsin enforces the Uniform Dwelling Code, COMM Chapters 20 through 25 (new one- and two-family dwelling units); the Building and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Code, COMM Chapters 50-64 (all commercial buildings as well as three or more units for residential buildings); the Rental Unit Energy Efficiencies Standards Code, COMM Chapter  67 (existing residential rental properties) and Credentials, and COMM Chapter 5.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1997, new COMM Chapter 63 requirements for commercial and multi-family dwellings (other than one- and two-family dwellings) went into effect.  These new comprehensive requirements were modeled after ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989.</p>

<p>Changes to the Uniform Dwelling Code, COMM Chapters 20-26, were proposed, and have been implemented.  As of May 1, 1999, COMM Chapter 22 of the Uniform Dwelling Code meets or exceeds the 1995 MEC.</p><BR>

Towns and counties that are established as local enforcement may, but are not required to, enforce an energy code at the local level.  Currently, 20 towns and counties are established as local enforcement.  As part of their normal building inspection process, the enforcement agency performs field inspections in these towns and counties.

<P><B>Background/History:</B><BR>

The 1976 edition of the Uniform Codes was adopted in 1977.  Prior to 1977, the State Fire Marshal's Office adopted and enforced the National Fire Prevention Agency standards.  Since 1977, the state has adopted the current version of the Uniform Building Code consistent with its three-year publication cycle.  The current energy provisions are contained in Appendix Chapter 53 of the 1991 Uniform Building Code, which references the 1989 Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code (MEC.)<BR>
